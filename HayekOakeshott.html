<p class="head2"><b>Abstract</b></p>
<p class="p4">F.
A.
Hayek and Michael Oakeshott were two of the most prominent 20th century critics of what they referred to as "rationalism." The two thinkers knew each other personally, and read each other's work.
So it would be easy to assume that, when each attacked rationalism, each was aiming his arrows at the same enemy.</p>
<p class="p7">But was this really the case? In this paper, I will argue that, in fact, Hayek and Oakeshott understood the problem of rationalist thought quite differently.
Furthermore, I contend, this difference is not a mere "brute fact," but can be understood as based in their differing philosophical outlooks.</p>

<br>

<p class="head2"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class="p4">In the first half of the twentieth century, the rationalist tide had reached its high mark.
The arts, child rearing, and business management, so it was held, were to be revolutionized according to rationalist precepts.
In architecture and city planning, rationalism would sweep away that unnecessary clutter of old prejudices that restrained traditional architecture and customary urban organization and build the modern, functional buildings and communities that people truly needed.
And, with the Soviet Union seen as setting the example of a shining city on a hill, society as a whole was to be transformed into a utopia by tossing aside all attachment to atavistic customs and ancient moral relics and proceeding to design social affairs from first principles.</p>
<p class="p9">But the many disappointing outcomes of the rationalist program have considerably dimmed its popularity.
However, the evidence of those practical failures would not have been as convincing as it was—perhaps it was the case that we just had not found the proper rationalist program yet?—if not for the existence of a theoretical diagnosis of the malady.
That diagnosis was provided by a number of theorists in the mid-twentieth century.
This paper aims to compare and contrast the ideas of two of those leading critics of rationalism, F.A.
Hayek and Michael Oakeshott.
While each of them certainly criticized “rationalism,” did each mean the same thing by it? In what senses did their analyses of the issue overlap, and in what senses did they differ? In this paper, I will argue that, in fact, Hayek and Oakeshott understood the problem of rationalist thought quite differently.
Furthermore, I contend, this difference is not a mere "brute fact," but can be understood as based in their differing philosophical outlooks.
Clarifying these issues could provide important insights into this important topic.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>Hayek and Oakeshott</b></p>
<p class="p4">Hayek and Oakeshott have a curious intellectual relationship.
Their backgrounds were fairly different: Hayek was an economist, first made aware of the limits of rationalism through analyzing the hurdles facing the central planner who was supposed to rationally reorganize production in the socialist commonwealth.
Oakeshott was trained as an historian, and launched his investigations of rationalism from his study of philosophical idealism.
Besides frequently being paired as major 20th-century critics of rationalism, they also have in common long periods of employment at the London School of Economics, as well as prominent places, which perhaps neither desired, in the pantheon of modern conservative heroes.
Nevertheless, the only references I have encountered by Oakeshott to Hayek’s work are his somewhat dismissive summary of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>, and a very sympathetic review of <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>.
Hayek praised Oakeshott, for example, in the introduction to <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, but Hayek never, to my knowledge, produced any in-depth commentary on the views of his purported counterpart.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>Hayek on Rationalism</b></p>
<p class="p4">Hayek's philosophy, while never articulated at great length, appears to have been a variety of "emergent phenomena" materialism.
In his view, reason was not an aspect of human activities in general, but only emerged in the process of abstracting from "sensory input" any number of scientific laws, legal rules, heuristics for deciding on practical courses of action, and so on.
Working from this base, Hayek criticized "rationalism" as a failure to recognize how limited reason is in its application.
The “abuse of reason” consists in trying to use our rationality to direct irrational (or, at best, “ecologically rational”) processes it cannot fully grasp, such as the historical development of our customs, norms, conventions and institutions.
For Hayek, particular, historical situations cannot be rationally understood, since, for him, reason is identical to “abstract thought.” Hayek did famously stress the importance of knowledge of “the particular circumstances of time and place” (“The Use of Knowledge in Society”), but it is unclear how his epistemology makes such knowledge possible.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>Hayek’s Critique of Conservatism</b></p>
<p class="p4">Hayek’s essay entitled “Why I Am Not a Conservative,” which was published as a postscript in <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>, can be taken as an implicit criticism of Oakeshott.</p>
<p class="p7">Hayek opens that essay by acknowledging the genuine virtue he detects in the conservative political disposition, writing, “Conservatism proper is a legitimate, probably necessary, and certainly widespread attitude of opposition to drastic change.
It has, since the French Revolution, for a century and a half played an important role in European politics.”</p>
<p class="p7">Even so, his admiration for conservatism was quite qualified.
He continues:</p>
<p class="p12">Let me now state what seems to me the decisive objection to any conservatism which deserves to be called such.
It is that by its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving.
It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies in slowing down undesirable developments, but, since it does not indicate another direction, it cannot prevent their continuance.
It has, for this reason, invariably been the fate of conservatism to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing.
The tug of war between conservatives and progressives can only affect the speed, not the direction, of contemporary developments.
But, though there is a need for a ‘brake on the vehicle of progress’, I personally cannot be content with simply helping to apply the brake.</p>
<p class="p4">In a passage that quite credibly could be read as being directed against political approaches such as the one Oakeshott, at times, seems to endorse, Hayek contends:</p>
<p class="p12">This brings me to the first point on which the conservative and the liberal dispositions differ radically.
As has often been acknowledged by conservative writers, one of the fundamental traits of the conservative attitude is a fear of change, a timid distrust of the new as such, while the liberal position is based on courage and confidence, on a preparedness to let change run its course even if we cannot predict where it will lead.
There would not be much to object to if the conservatives merely disliked too rapid change in institutions and public policy; here the case for caution and slow process is indeed strong.
But the conservatives are inclined to use the powers of government to prevent change or to limit its rate to whatever appeals to the more timid mind.</p>
<p class="p4">Hayek, in the above, has indicated a crucial problem confronting Oakeshottian political theory, and one that, it seems to me, Oakeshott ought to have addressed in greater depth, namely, that of how his endorsement of looking to the “intimations” of existing practices for guiding political change can avoid taking on the role of a merely providing intellectual cover for whatever power structure is currently in place.</p>
<p class="p9">Nevertheless, Hayek’s thought grew closer to Oakeshott’s over time, to the extent that his three-volume work from the 1970s, <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, often reads like an expansion of Oakeshott’s essays on rationalism, and posits a key distinction between ‘spontaneous orders’ and ‘organizations’ that closely parallels Oakeshott’s between ‘civil’ and ‘enterprise’ associations.</p>
<p class="p9">At first glance, Hayek, by the time he is writing <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, sometimes seems to be echoing Oakeshott’s views from ‘Rationalism in Politics’, for instance, when he writes:</p>
<p class="p12">The first view holds that human institutions will serve human purposes only if they have been deliberately designed for these purposes, often also that the fact that an institution exists is evidence of its having been created for a purpose, and always that we should so re-design society and its institutions that all our actions will be wholly guided by known purposes.
To most people these propositions seem almost self-evident and to constitute a attitude alone worthy of a thinking being.
Yet the belief underlying them, that we all owe all beneficial institutions to design, and that only such design has made or can make them useful for our purposes, is largely false.
(1973: 8-9)</p>
<p class="p4">Or this:</p>
<p class="p12">Yet the basic assumption underlying the belief that man has achieved mastery of his surroundings mainly through his capacity for logical deduction from explicit premises is factually false, and any attempt to confine his actions to what could thus be justified would deprive him of many of the most effective means to success that have been available to him.
It is simply not true that our actions owe their effectiveness solely or chiefly to the knowledge which we can state in words and which can therefore constitute the explicit premises of a syllogism.
(1973: 11)</p>
<p class="p10"><br></p>
<p class="p9">However, even at this stage of his thought, Hayek was still, despite his critique of what he calls ‘constructivist rationalism’, proposing abstract rules to fix the problem.
So Hayek writes something like, ‘That freedom can be preserved only if it is treated as a supreme principle which must not be sacrificed for particular advantages was fully understood by the leading liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century…’ (1973: 72), and one realizes there is something significantly different is going on here.
Taleb notes the paradox here: “We may… think that… Hayek would be in the antifragile, antirationalist category… But Hayek missed the notion of optionality…” (2014: 258).</p>
<p class="p9">Or, as Rowland wrote:</p>
<p class="p12">On the one hand, Hayek appears to evaluate institutions according to whether they are the products of spontaneous evolution; liberty and order, he suggests, are a product of such evolutionary processes.
On the other hand, his development of a model constitution appears to demonstrate his willingness to engage in rational design, exactly the process his traditionalism argues against.
(1988: 222)</p>
<p class="p4">Oakeshott, on the other hand, never would have written up a model constitution.
What is the source of this difference? I suggest they arise from even deeper differences lurking beneath the surface similarity of Oakeshott's and Hayek's understanding of rationalism, connected to Oakeshott's idealism.</p>
<p class="head3"><b>The Sensory Order</b></p>
<p class="p4">In <i>The Sensory Order</i>, Hayek tries to depict how thought itself, which for him means abstract thought, can arise from entirely thoughtless processes.
But he has left himself here a conundrum that I suggest is impossible to solve: How in the world can any sensible abstraction be drawn from a welter of particulars that are, in and of themselves, not susceptible to being understood?</p>
<p class="p7">Hayek's thought runs aground in this regard because he had not recognized the significance of the revolution in philosophy initiated by Hegel: he had not grasped the idea of the “concrete universal.” On the other hand, Oakeshott's critique of rationalism is based upon that very concept.</p>
<p class="head2"><b>Oakeshott on Rationalism</b></p>
<p class="p4">For Oakeshott, the problem is not that our reason is not up to the job of grappling with our practical affairs, including those of our political life.
Instead, as he points out in <i>Experience and Its Modes</i>, the world of practice is itself a world of ideas.
Concrete reality is, in and of itself, comprehensible.</p>
<p class="p7">Thus when Oakeshott attacks rationalism, he is not claiming that it is a case of reason going beyond its limits, as Hayek does.
Instead, rationalism for Oakeshott is the attempt to replace practical reason (phronesis) with abstract, theoretical reason (theoria).</p>
<p class="head2"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p class="p9">The key to understanding how, starting from a similar critique of rationalism, Hayek arrives at such a different position from Oakeshott lies, as mentioned above, in the fact that Oakeshott is an idealist while Hayek is not.
Since for Oakeshott the world is a world of ideas, the concrete is inherently intelligible in and of its self.
For Hayek, on the other hand, what is opposed to abstract thought is not concrete thought, but instinct, mechanism, or emotion.
Writing of Hegel’s statement that ‘the view which clings to abstraction is liberalism, over which the concrete always prevails…’ Hayek contends ‘he truly described the fact that we are not yet mature enough to submit for any length of time to strict discipline of reason and allow our emotions to constantly break through its restraints’ (1973: 33), he fails to understand that for Hegel, as for most of the Idealists who followed him, concrete thought was the <i>telos</i> of reason, and not a fall from it.
Hayek believes that the relationships that make up his ‘Great Society’ are abstract because the <i>theory</i> of such relationships is highly abstract; but those relationships themselves are concrete: <i>this</i> businessman buys <i>this</i> amount of concrete from <i>this</i> vendor to be delivered at <i>this</i> time and <i>this</i> place.
For Hayek, trying to intelligently decide policies on a case-by-case basis will only result in irrational, emotional interventions that eventually will lead us down ‘the road to serfdom’; only a dogmatic insistence on classical liberal principles can preserve freedom.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">In short, for Hayek, the rationalist is one who does not realize that the single tool human reason possesses, that of abstract, theoretical reasoning, is not up to all tasks.
To the contrary, Oakeshott argues that the problem itself stems from believing that there is only one tool available to human reason.
The rationalist is in the position of someone using a hand saw to cut the lawn.</p>
