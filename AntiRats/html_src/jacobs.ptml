            <p>
                Any city that aspires to greatness will have something to
                offend everyone.  That is a feature, not a bug.  In the absence
                of perfect knowledge, people are attracted to a great city for
                the opportunities, imagined and unimaginable, that it offers
                them.  But the absence of perfect knowledge means they have to
                experiment, and the accompanying trials and errors necessarily
                generate discord, confusion, and disappointment along with
                innovation, satisfaction, and success.  Understanding how the
                institutions underlying successful cities – property rights,
                exchange, and the norms of trust and reciprocity – promote or
                hinder such a process is therefore essential for effective
                urban policy.  The large-scale responses to these problems have
                historically misunderstood the nature and significance of
                cities and have ranged from Olmstead to Le Corbusier.  The
                consequence of such “constructivist rationalist” approaches is
                to stifle the emergent creativity of a great city.
