            Abstract
        </h3>

        <p>
            C.S. Lewis was a major public intellectual in Britain, beginning
            from the late 1930s and continuing to his death in 1963. In both
            his non-fiction, especially <i>The Abolition of Man</i> (1943), and
            his fiction, most importantly in <i>That Hideous Strength</i>
            (1945), he offers a critique of rationalism and scientism that is
            often strikingly similar to those that Michael Oakeshott penned 
            in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This paper will examine the 
            question of to what extent this similarity is merely superficial,
            and to what extent the two writers shared a similar basis for their
            views. Furthermore, it will examine whether there is an actual
            thread of influence: had Oakeshott been reading Lewis before
            writing his critique of rationalism, and if so, to what extent did
            Lewis's work inform Oakeshott's?

            Introduction
        </h3>

        <p>
            "To some it will appear that I have merely restored under another
            name what they always meant by basic or fundamental instinct. But
            much more than a choice of words is involved. The Innovator attacks
            traditional values (the Tao) in defense of what he at first
            supposes to be (in some special sense) ‘rational’ or ‘biological’
            values. But as we have seen, all the values which he uses in
            attacking the Tao, and even claims to be substituting for it, are
            themselves derived from the Tao. If he had really started from
            scratch, from right outside the human tradition of value, no
            jugglery could have advanced him an inch towards the conception
            that a man should die for the community or work for posterity. If
            the Tao falls, all his own conceptions of value fall with it. Not
            one of them can claim any authority other than that of the Tao.
            Only by such shreds of the Tao as he has inherited is he enabled
            even to attack it. The question therefore arises what title he has
            to select bits of it for acceptance and to reject others. For if
            the bits he rejects have no authority, neither have those he
            retains: If what he retains is valid, what he rejects is equally
            valid too." -- <i>The Abolition of Man</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            "What purport to be new systems, or (as they now call them)
            ‘ideologies,’ all consist of fragments from the Tao itself,
            arbitrarily wrenched from their context in the whole and then
            swollen to madness in their isolation, yet still owing to the Tao
            and to it alone such validity as they possess. If my duty to my
            parents is a superstition, then so is my duty to posterity. If
            justice is a superstition, then so is my duty to my country or my
            race. If the pursuit of scientific knowledge is a real value, then
            so is conjugal fidelity. The rebellion of new ideologies against
            the Tao is a rebellion of the branches against the tree: if the
            rebels could succeed they would find that they had destroyed
            themselves. The human mind has no more power of inventing a new
            value than of imagining a new primary colour, or, indeed, of
            creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in." -- <i>The
                Abolition of Man</i>
