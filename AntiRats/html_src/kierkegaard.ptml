            <p>
            This chapter explores the critique of the rationality of political
            discourse in Søren Kierkegaard’s <i>Two Ages</i>. Kierkegaard
            argues that participants in the emerging newspaper public of the
            1840s lack the passion to match their words with deeds. He can be
            credited with identifying a new separation between political speech
            and political action among participants in the mediated public
            sphere. Kierkegaard then attempts to unmask ulterior motives like
            envy and status competition that belie the surface-level
            rationality of mediated political discourse. The chapter aims to
            clarify the sense in which Kierkegaard is a critic of political
            rationalism, trace the limits of his critique, and argue for its
            continuing relevance today.
