            <p>
                Since the beginning of the Modern era, and into the
                Enlightenment, science and its method have been seen as the way
                to overcome the darkness and the distortion that religious
                authority and powerful interests could disseminate. It is still
                a common conception in the 21st century that science, in
                opposition to religions and traditions, provides, or can
                provide, all the answers that we need. Michael Polanyi was a
                scientist and philosopher who showed that the Enlightenment's
                standards for knowledge were distortions that could have
                destructive effects. It's critical rationalism led to a
                "scientism" in which meaning and human value were illusions and
                only facts based in physics could be affirmed as true.
                Alternatively, it also led to a post-modern repudiation of
                objectivity in which truth itself was an illusion, subservient
                to subjective emotion or political power. Polanyi's
                post-critical philosophy revised Enlightenment standards to
                more accurately reflect how science does proceed. He revised
                the understanding of (1) objective truth, (2) the separation of
                mind/value from world/fact, (3) a Cartesian explicit analysis
                to simplest self-evident truths, and (4) its concomitant
                reductive analysis of reality to smallest physical parts. He
                did this with his conceptions of (1) personal knowledge, (2)
                indwelling, (3) tacit knowing, and (4) emergent being. Polanyi
                showed that science actually moves forward toward truth and
                better contact with reality by using the same tools of
                practical knowing that can affirm the efforts of cultural and
                religious traditions that are open to dialogue and discovery.
                His way of looking at truth and reality allows that values, and
                not just physical facts, can be real discoveries about the
                world. He opens up possibilities for understanding beyond
                simple dualisms and reductionisms, forestalls a regression into
                nihilism, and renews hope in human progress.
