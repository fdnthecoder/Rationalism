        <p>
            Renowned primarily for his thoughts about pluralism, it is
            surprising to note that relatively little attention has been paid
            to what Isaiah Berlin says about the idea of monism. Generally
            concerned with explicating his views about value-pluralism
            commentators have tended to gloss Berlin's thoughts about monism.
            This is, I believe, a mistake. For given the significance of monism
            for Berlin - who spends no small amount of time discussing this
            idea and its consequences - how can one claim to grasp the whole of
            his thought if a crucial portion of it is neglected? This, then, is
            the question I intend to address in this chapter: "What, exactly,
            does Berlin say about monism?"
