# HyperCritical Race Theory

Gene Callahan



Ideologies gain their plausibility because they have genuinely pointed at
something that is really a sin, say "racism" or "capitalist exploitation." The
problem with them is that they try to treat that one sin as though it were the
only sin in existence.


How to differentiate a religious leader from a cult leader: a religious leader
tries to point followers to a greater reality which he admits he only partially
comprehends. A cult leader tries to entrap followers in an epistemic closure in
which he knows everything.


"Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small... the purpose is not
to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the
less it correspond to reality the better."
â€” Theodore Dalrymple

The charge of "whataboutism" is *not* a way of replying to a critic. It is a way of *ignoring* the critic. Look:

MARXIST: The capitalists exploited the workers.

CRITIC: OK, but what about the fact that the USSR threw millions of workers into Gulags?

MARXIST: Ah! Whataboutism!!!
