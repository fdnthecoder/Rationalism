        James Scott is a political scientist and anthropologist, most famous
        for his work on the limitations of state rationality, peasant economy
        and the "subaltern" political activity of groups excluded by the state.
        His work highlights the intimate connection between the
        Weberian-Westphalian state and impersonal enlightenment rationality. On
        his score, states can govern only through the schema of such a
        rationality and their activities are legitimated in turn by the
        prestige of it. I argue that implicit within Scott's anthropological
        and social-scientific work is an antinomian or "anarchist" critique of
        the state grounded in an epistemic critique of impersonal enlightenment
        reason. For Scott, effective practical reasoning needs to be
        contextually-sensitive and is unavoidably perspectival â€“ reasons belong
        to an agent in virtue of the time and place in which they are situated.
        The "synoptic" rationality of the large-scale state, which can govern
        only on the basis of an impersonal standpoint disembedded from time and
        place, is revealed to suffer from stark limitations in his work.
