            Abstract
            </h2>

        <p>
        In the hands of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, phenomenology
        became a way of reflecting upon the rigor of philosophy and science.
        While Husserl aimed at adding rigor to philosophical investigation,
        Heidegger, more profoundly, reveals the inherent weaknesses of the
        sciences, such as mathematics, physics and biology, in “obtaining and
        securing the primary way of access to what are supposedly the objects
        of this science.” Heidegger claims that the phenomenological method
        reveals the a priori conditions necessary for the sciences mentioned
        above, and the inherent weaknesses and blind spots of those
        disciplines.  In this chapter, I propose to explain Heidegger’s
        criticism of scientific reasoning along with his call for a more
        profound approach to thinking that references both medieval and
        pre-Socratic world-views.
        </p>
            
            <h2>
            Introduction
            </h2>

            <p>
            In the hands of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, phenomenology
            became a way of reflecting upon the rigor of philosophy and
            science. While Husserl aimed at adding rigor to philosophical
            investigation, Heidegger attacked scientific thinking as having
            fallen under the sway of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
            Heidegger points to Plato as the end of Greek thought and the
            beginning of a Western rationality that would give in to
            technological thinking, and I begin this chapter by identifying a
            brief passage in the Republic that demonstrates the shift towards
            technological mode of thinking. Here Plato compares the nature of a
            person to the nature of a tool.
            </p>
            <p>
            Heidegger is also concerned with the extent to which modern science
            focuses on efficient causes (cause and effect), to the general
            exclusion of Aristotle’s formal cause, material cause and final
            cause. While efficient causes can provide material explanations for
            events, they cannot provide events with purpose of meaning. As a
            result, Heidegger contends that modern science results in nihilism.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally, I explain what technological thinking entails and what we
            might understand to be alternatives to technological modes of
            thinking. This is challenging because the metaphysics of modernity
            distorts alternative modes of thinking, and because Heidegger’s
            reference to pre-Socratic thinkers deploys what might be considered
            an intentionally obtuse vocabulary. But Heidegger’s early work on
            Duns Scotus offers a simpler entre into a world that is
            philosophically and scientifically interesting, unyoked from the
            distortions of modern, technological thought.
