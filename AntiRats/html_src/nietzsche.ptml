            Abstract
            </h2>
            
            <p>
            In countless public speeches and pieces of private correspondence,
            Thomas Jefferson proclaimed the innate goodness and rationality of
            human beings. He believed governments propped up by irrational
            claims of authority, particularly the “monkish ignorance” of
            religious authority, had subverted these qualities too often.
            Diminished liberty and pervasive despair prevailed throughout the
            world. Fortunately, a new science of politics, one grounded in
            reason rather than superstition, offered hope because it allowed
            for the discovery of a rational foundation for government worthy of
            the people it would serve. Although the United States was the first
            country to implement a regime based on reason, Jefferson sincerely
            expected America to inspire other nations, and, eventually, all
            nations, to embrace the new rationalism and trust their people with
            self-governance. Sentiments such as these have led many political
            theorists, historians, and regular citizens to view Jefferson as an
            embodiment of American political idealism, love for humanity, and
            faith in reason.

            For Jefferson, reason provided access to the truth about reality
            and initiated a desperately needed break from a decadent past
            filled with incense and nonsense. Reason was the guide to progress
            as well as the means to ending history itself. Friedrich Nietzsche
            would find much to object to in these areas of Jefferson’s
            political thought. In many writings, Nietzsche argued rationalism
            did not inaugurate a break from the religious past so much as it
            re-packaged pre-existing ethical and political beliefs in language
            stripped of many theological and metaphysical associations. Thus,
            modern rationalism was no new thing under the sun; it was an
            example of a serious problem Nietzsche already identified in
            Christianity, that is, nihilism.

            <p>
            In this chapter, Nietzsche’s understanding of reason, morality,
            equality, Christianity, and democracy will be described and applied
            to an explanation and analysis of the same elements of Jefferson’s
            political thought. By borrowing Nietzsche’s hammer to "sound out"
            Jefferson’s mind, it will be argued that Jefferson’s oft-celebrated
            democracy of reason is tinged with misanthropy and world hatred. In
            other words, such a vision is a manifestation of the ascetic ideal
            and thus is ultimately nihilistic.  Because many see Jefferson as a
            paradigmatic figure in the American Founding, even as an
            incarnation of the American spirit, the chapter has broad
            implications for interpreting a fundamental dimension of the
            American political tradition.
