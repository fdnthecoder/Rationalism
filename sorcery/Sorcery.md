# Woke Sorcery

Gene Callahan

"Midnight on a carousel ride  
Reaching for that gold ring  
Down inside  
Never could reach it  
Just slips away  
When I try"  

It may seem bizarre to analyze any current world events as involving sorcery:
surely, sorcery is something that was never real, and attempts at sorcery
disappeared hundreds of years ago.

To the contrary, the political philosopher Eric Voegelin demonstrated that many
of the new political ideologies that have arisen during the recent three
centuries have, in fact, been efforts to change the world by casting a spell of
words over it.

Voegelin aimed his analysis chiefly at 19th-century thinkers such as Hegel,
Marx, and Comte. He notes that Hegel, in particular, quite clearly saw himself
as a sorcerer, as he talked about his *Zauberworte* (magic words) and his
*Zauberkraft* (magic force), that would transform reality.

But Voegelin's analysis applies equally well to more modern sorcerers.
I myself fell into the enchantment of the spell of one of them:
that spell, called "Scientology," cast by L. Ron Hubbard.
After two years, I was able to break free of the spell only when presented with
an analysis of how such a spell could be cast: once that happened, I realized
that Hubbard had literally entrapped me in a net woven by his words.

The analysis of sorcery that enabled me to understand what Hubbard was doing
was provided to me by Carlos Castañeda, in his discussion of "the second ring
of power," in books that quite explicitly were about sorcery. I have no idea if
Castañeda had ever read Voegelin, but it is interesting that Voegelin posited
that sorcery was an attempt to create a "second reality."
 
But what is this "second ring of power," or "second reality"? It is a reality
created by a spell of words, that is supposed to be more real than the primary
reality that we encounter every day.

How in the world could a "sorcerer" create such a "second reality" or possibly
make living in it it seem preferable to living in primary reality?

The first thing a sorcerer must do is seduce his acolytes into the secondary
reality by offering some genuine insights about the nature of primary reality.
So, for instance, Hegel, a brilliant student of the history of philosophy,
could offer his readers novel perspectives on the development of the subject.
Marx, who was a keen observer of the social scene around him, could provide
genuine insights into mid-19th-century European social relations. Hubbard, who
had studied Buddhism, psychoanalysis, and cybernetics, could offer potential
acolytes an interesting perspective on their psychological difficulties with
what he called "Dianetics." The genuine gains many people made with Dianetic
processing lured them into Scientology. Ayn
Rand, another modern sorcerer, had absorbed much of Aristotle, and had personal
experience with collectivist tyranny in the USSR, and thus could offer real
insights into collectivist madness.

Voegelin describes this feature of sorcerers' construction of a dreamworld:
"Replacing the first reality of experience by the second reality of imaginative
construction, and endowing the imaginary reality with the appearance of truth
by letting it absorb pieces of first reality" ("On Hegel," page 224).

And this sort of sorcery is far more widespread than just the few thinkers I have
mentioned; as Voegelin notes,
it is "the great confidence game played by modern man... under such titles as
advertisement, propaganda, communication, and comprehensively, as ideological
politics" (OH, p. 225).

Thus, ideologies gain their plausibility because they have genuinely pointed at
something that is really a problem, say "racism" or "capitalist exploitation."
But typically they try to treat this *one* problem as if it were the generator
of *all* problems.

The truths offered by a sorcerer, however, only serve as lures, inviting
acolytes into the sorcerer’s second reality. Once "hooked" by these lures,
the apprentice is then "educated" into a whole new way of viewing the world.
This new vision is made attractive by the assertion on the part of the sorcerer
that those who have embraced it are now superior to the run-of-the-mill
humanity who have not done so. For example, followers of Hegel are told that
they are at the forefront of the historical development of *geist*, or the
"world spirit." Discussing Hegel, Voegelin observes: "Hegel's obsession was
power. If he wanted to be the sorcerer who could evoke the shape of history, he
had to penetrate the political events of the time with though until the events
and thought would coincide" (OH, 235).

Similarly, the most devoted Marxists are assured that they are "the vanguard of
the proletariat." The devotees of Hubbard were promised that they could become
"operating thetans," acquiring capabilities not available to
non-Scientologists.  And a Randian hero could live a life of freedom in "Galt's
Gulch."

A recent example of sorcery is what is often called "neoconservatism." The
secondary reality neoconservatives attempt to create is one in which all
actions by the United States are, by definition, virtuous, and all people,
around the world, have as their deepest aspiration to become American.

Ron Suskind reported on a conversation with a (neoconservative)
Bush administration official as follows:

"The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based
community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from
your judicious study of discernible reality.' [...] 'That's not the way the
world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we
act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that
reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities,
which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's
actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'"

It is stunning how explicit this official was about ignoring the primary
reality of experience and creating "our own reality." If one were to write a
fictional character intended to exemplify Voegelin's concept of sorcery, and
put thos words in his mouth, a critic would probably call it too blatant.

The promise of being able to create one's own reality is
very seductive: As Voegelin noted, "Once you have
entered into the magic circle the sorcerer has drawn around himself, you are
lost" (OH, 228).

Having examined the general nature of sorcery, and of the *Zauberworte*, 
the magic words
sorcerers use to cast their spell, we can proceed to look at the specific 
case of "woke sorcery."

We can begin with an old example.
Although the "woke" have not recently paid much attention to mental
disabilities, we can see an early example of the effort to change reality by
word magic in the continually shifting terms for people afflicted with such a
disability. As Rick Hodges writes:

"In 1910, the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for
Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons adopted three classifications of people we
know today as intellectually disabled, as defined by a newly invented way to
measure intelligence we now call the IQ test. 'Morons' were the most
intelligent — they had IQs between 50 and 70. 'Imbeciles' with IQs between 25
and 50 were the second level. Those below 25 would remain 'idiots.'"
(https://humanparts.medium.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-mentally-retarded-e3b9eea23018)

But these terms -- and "moron" was a brand new one,  with no prior meaning --
gradually came to be insults. So they were replaced with "mentally retarded" --
until "retarded" also became an insult. So "intellectually disabled" was in,
and "retarded" came to be regarded as "hate speech."

In primary reality, what is at issue is that those
of us with normal mental capacities should
exercise kindness and compassion towards those who are not so blessed, and
realize that it is no accomplishment of our own, for instance, not to be born
with Down's Syndrome.  But *that* involves a change of heart, and is more
difficult to accomplish than is a change in terminology.

Too many people feel the intellect they have been gifted with is somehow their own
accomplishment, and thus feel entitled to those who have not been equally
gifted. Tellingly, Hodges himself does not recommend this change of heart, but
instead recommends a *new* form of word magic: simply asserting that a
disability is not really a disability; just assert, he says, that there is
"nothing wrong" with being mentally retarded. This "solution" is just as nonsensical
as trying to jump off the "euphemism treadmill" by continually changing words:
of course, there is *something* wrong with someone who has an "intellectual
disability": they have more than ordinary trouble learning new things, just as
there is something wrong with someone who is blind: they can't see.
Only a belief in *Zauberworte* could result in someone thinking that
the only problem a person with an IQ of 30 has is that others think there is
something wrong with him. But the person is nevertheless a child of God, and
fully worthy of our love whatever disability they suffer from. Furthermore,
there is "something wrong" with all of us, which should make us pause if we
contemplate mocking or taking advantage of what is wrong with someone else.

The attempt to address social ills by word magic is apparent in the shifting
terms by which it is considered acceptable to refer to people of sub-Saharan
African descent. "Negro" was once fine, but was replaced by "colored," as in
the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People." But then
"colored" was denigrated, and "black" became correct. Then "black" was out, and
"African-American" was de rigueur.

The last term was so strongly promoted
at one time, especially in our schools,
that my then young son, knowing that I had studied Ghanian music, asked 
me, "Aren't most of the people in Ghana African-American?"

"No," I told him, "most of them are African-African."

And the use of the new term certainly did not stop people from
stereotyping. Once, my next-door-neighbor (herself a "minority" in at least two
senses!) called me up while I was at work, and
told me, "A truck pulled up in your driveway... and a bunch of
*African-Americans* got out of it... I'm worried you're being robbed."

In fact, this was a tree-cutting crew I had hired. But notice how my neighbor,
in her racial stereotyping, was careful to use the then politically correct
term for the men she saw, as though such word magic could erase the
stereotyping.

But today, "African-American" is out, and "Black," with a capital "B," is in.
This ridiculous dance from word to word for describing the same group of people
illustrates the attractiveness of belief in word magic. Certainly, there remain
white Americans who are genuine racists. And anyone of good will should strive
to disabuse them of their ignorance. But the notion that we can make progress
on this front by continually changing the word by which we refer to the subject
of their prejudice ought to be dismissed as laughable... unless one has fallen
under the spell of a sorcerer.

A curious example of word magic amongst "anti-racists" (which means people who
think about almost nothing but race) is the notion of "racist dog whistle,"
or "coded" racist messages.
Plain-old dog whistles, of course, are designed to make a sound at a pitch that
dogs can hear, but humans cannot. By analogy, a racist dog whistle is some
"coded" phrase by which racists can identify as such to other racists, but that
non-racists will mistake for some innocent language. (For example, just the
other day I heard a wokester claim that the phrase "civilized society" is a dog
whistle.) It is a sort of "secret Masonic handshake," but for racists.

The difficulty here arises from the fact that anti-racists continually claim to
be able to "hear" these dog whistles, quite distinctly. But if they are
designed to be recognizable only by racists... then wouldn't the woke who hear
them have to be racist themselves? "No," they respond, "we have just studied
these racists and broken their code." Then in that case, wouldn't the racists
pick a new code, one that hasn't been broken? When the Allies broke a German
code in WWII, they were very careful to hide the fact, so that the Germans
would keep using the (now useless) code. But the woke declare publicly, every
hour of every day, on Twitter, on Facebook, and in [WOKE PUB HERE] that they
have broken the racists' code. Are we supposed to imagine that the racists are
clever enough to disguise their racism in seemingly innoccuous phrases like
"civilized society," and yet too stupid to change their code once it was so
thoroughly and publicly exposed? And if someone is tempted to respond, "Well,
of course, racists are stupid!", they might contemplate the fact that pretty
much no one ever has been as racist as the Nazis running Germany during World
War II, and yet those racists were diabolically clever at fighting a war.

No, no explanation for this conundrum is forthcoming. And that is because this
is not a serious theory about secret communication channels, but a use of word
magic to "curse" those whose views the woke disagree with by attaching the
stigma of racism to them.

Word magic is also rampant in "gender" discussions. In fact, the very shift
from talking about a person's "sex" to talking about a person's "gender" was
itself an instance of word magic, as though discussing the biological reality
of sexual dimorphism as if it were an arbitrary category like gender in a
language could transform biological reality into social convention.


People are "assigned" a gender at birth. They "really" are whatever gender they
choose to adopt. (Notice the belief in *Zauberworte* implicit in this position:
it doesn't matter if you have a penis, testicles, and lots of testosterone
coursing through your body: just so long as others refer to you as "she," you
*really are* a woman. (And further, if they refer to you as "ze" or "they" or
"flaubergaustemis", then you *really are* some imaginary alternative sex.


"Peaceful protests"

Dan's example!

No matter how much violence is occurring, so long as we *call* what is going on
"peaceful protests", they actually will be, magically, made peaceful. In the
meantime, a white person sitting quietly by himself, eating his lunch, is
actually engaged in *violence*, since he is not helping the peaceful protesters
loot stores and burn cars.


Perhaps one of the most stunning feats of *Zauberworte* performed by the woke
has been the re-definition of "racism" itself. The "old" definition is stated
succinctly at the beginning of the Wikipedia article on racism:

"Racism is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits
corresponding to physical appearance and can be divided based on the
superiority of one race over another." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism)
This definition captures what people usually mean when they say, "So-and-so is
a racist," and also fits well with historical examples of racism, such as the
ideas that supported black slavery in the United States or the persecution of
Jews in Nazi Germany. Quite clearly, it is not a definition designed to "support
white supremacy" or in any way "let white people off the hook": many of the
most egregious examples of racist belief and practice involve some white people
believing themselves genetically superior to some other group, although not
infrequently that has been another group of white people, for example, European
anti-semitism (Nazi Germany being the most extreme example), or the attitude of
the English towards the Irish for some centuries, or the widespread belief
among northern Europeans that they were better than their southern
counterparts. But, of course, there are many other examples of Europeans
holding racist beliefs vis-a-vis non-Europeans, towards Asian Indians, towards the
Chinese, towards American Indians, and towards black Africans.

Thankfully, although such beliefs persist in some quarters, today
they are widely discredited, and rejected by "polite society." For instance,
the University of Illinois reports: "One of the most substantial changes in
white racial attitudes [among Americans] 
has been the movement from very substantial opposition
to the principle of racial equality to one of almost universal support."
(https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes)

So, given that we should never expect perfection in the city of man, this would
seem to signal "mission accomplished," in terms of discrediting white racism,
right? But then, if one has built an ideological dream world holding that the
essential life difficulty facing black Americans is white racism, what is one
to do? Well, engage in some *Zauberworte*, and come up with a new definition of
racism, one that still condemns whites of this sin, despite the forementioned
change in attitudes, and, at the same time, excuses attitudes on the part of
non-whites that obviously would fall under the common-sense notion of what
racism is about.



The ideal of earlier opponents of racism, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, 
that "I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their
skin, but by the content of their character," has now been re-defined as being
actually a *racist* attitude, called "color-blindness." As Wikipedia expresses
the ideas of Eduardo Bonilla-Silva:
"At an individual level, people with 'color blind prejudice' reject racist
ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix institutional
racism." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism#Color_blindness) In other words,
in the realm of this word sorcery, *not* judging people by the color of their
skin is a "subtle" form of racism, and the evidence that a person is guilty of
this prejudice is that *they do not support the particular policies* their
accuser favors. The result is that if someone, for instance, opposes
affirmative-action admission to universities, arguing that they do not really
help black students, their argument need not even be entertained: that person
is a racist, guilty of "color blindness," and their case can be dismissed as
such.

Color-blind auditions for orchestras.


Man sits on a moving swing, rising at one moment so high that he feels he can
nearly touch heaven, dipping so low at the next that he Is singed by the flames
of hell. This is what Plato referred to as the metaxy, the "in-between" of
human existence. How great is the temptation, at the top of the arc, to try to
seize hold of that paradise so near.

"Truth is only intrasystemic... first you must accept the premises, then discuss
its content." — V. Pg 236 Drama

If you do not accept the premises of critical race theory, that cannot be
discussed: you are simply branded a racist, and dismissed.

"to believe on insufficient evidence is a decision, it’s an immoral act to
believe with insufficient evidence." V. 237

"Once this Mode of being has been realized, it is as difficult to get out of
it as it is to wake oneself up" V. quoting Sartre 238


Whether Race has any biological reality is irrelevant to ethical and political
questions, where the relevant question is "does it have any moral meaning?" but
while dismissing Race as a biological characteristic, it is the critical race
theory us who answer the latter question with a resounding "yes," in all of
their condemnation of "whiteness."

"The fanaticism of smashing all establish social order, of removing all
individual suspect of harboring order in their existence, and of annihilating
every attempt at re-organization. Only by destroying something has this
negative well the feeling of its own existence. Even if he believes to Willa
positive state, as friends since the state of general quality... It does in fact
not want its realization for that would reestablish the very order... From whose
annihilation this negative freedom drives it self-consciousness" — Voegelin
quoting Hegel, p. 158 vol. 12


How to differentiate a religious leader from a cult leader: a religious leader
tries to point followers to a greater reality which he admits he only partially
comprehends. A cult leader tries to entrap followers in an epistemic closure in
which he knows everything.


"Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small... the purpose is not
to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the
less it corresponds to reality the better."
— Theodore Dalrymple

The charge of "whataboutism" is *not* a way of replying to a critic. It is a way of *ignoring* the critic. Look:

MARXIST: The capitalists exploited the workers.

CRITIC: OK, but what about the fact that the USSR threw millions of workers into Gulags?

MARXIST: Ah! Whataboutism!!!
