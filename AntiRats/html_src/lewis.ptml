        <p>
            CS Lewis is considered one of the most prominent Christian
            apologists of the twentieth century. But he held a deep distrust of
            the work of the rational faculty that was not properly oriented by
            the imagination, which explains in large part his turn to writing
            imaginative fiction later in his life. Through his fiction Lewis
            was trying to demonstrate, rather than rationally explain, what the
            world would look like if Christianity and a broader moral worldview
            were true. Lewis explains this understanding of the imagination and
            its importance for right thinking in a variety of essays and in his
            two most profound books, The Abolition of Man and The Discarded
            Image. This chapter examines the arguments Lewis makes and the
            metaphors he uses in these works to demonstrate how the foremost
            Christian apologist of the twentieth century prioritized the
            imaginative faculty over the rational.
