            Abstract
            </h2>


        <p>
        In the hands of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, phenomenology
        became a way of reflecting upon the rigor of philosophy and science.
        While Husserl aimed at adding rigor to philosophical investigation,
        Heidegger, more profoundly, reveals the inherent weaknesses of the
        sciences, such as mathematics, physics and biology, in “obtaining and
        securing the primary way of access to what are supposedly the objects
        of this science.” Heidegger claims that the phenomenological method
        reveals the a priori conditions necessary for the sciences mentioned
        above, and the inherent weaknesses and blind spots of those
        disciplines.  In this chapter, I propose to explain Heidegger’s
        criticism of scientific reasoning along with his call for a more
        profound approach to thinking that references both medieval and
        pre-Socratic world-views.
