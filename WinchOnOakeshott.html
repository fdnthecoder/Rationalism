<p class="head1"><b>Winch on Following a Rule: A Wittgensteinian
Critique of Oakeshott</b>
</p>

<p class="author">By Gene Callahan
</p>


<h2>
<b>Introduction</b>
</h2>


<p>
This paper will address Peter Winch’s critique of
Michael Oakeshott’s view of human conduct. I argue that, as is
sometimes the case with Oakeshott, what seems, on the surface, to
be a disagreement with another, somewhat compatible thinker about a
matter of detail in some social theory in fact turns out to point
to a deeper philosophical divide. In particular, I contend, Winch,
as typical of those who only picked up on Oakeshott’s work in the
1940s and 1950s, when he became known for his critique of
rationalism, failed to understand the metaphysics underlying that
critique.
</p>


<p>
Of further interest for our purposes is that
Winch “takes it back” somewhat in his ‘Preface to the Second
Edition,’ although not explicitly: I will argue that, if read in
light of the considerations in this paper, the modifications Winch
suggests to his thesis largely remove his objections to Oakeshott,
and do so by re-conceptualizing the notion of the relationship of
rules to human action along the lines I suggest here. But to begin,
lets look at the position of ontology in idealist philosophy versus
the position of epistemology in analytical philosophy.
</p>


<h2>
<b>Ontology Versus Epistemology</b>
</h2>


<p>
Winch, of course, is a Wittgensteinian, and bases
his arguments in <i>The Idea of a Social Science</i> on
Wittgenstein’s idea of forms of life. That idea bears an obvious
resemblance to the concept of modes in Oakeshott’s work. However, I
will demonstrate, there is an important difference in the
philosophical underpinnings of “forms of life” and “modes of
experience”: Winch’s (and Wittgenstein’s?) framework is
epistemological, while Oakeshott’s is ontological.
Winch is trying to explain the puzzle of how, once we
accept the subject-object dichotomy as fundamental, is it possible
for people to act “reasonably”? With people trapped in their
subjective worlds, how can there be any external standard for
reasonable behavior? Winch, taking up the Wittgensteinian notion of
a “language game,” which exhibits a human-made rationality that has
no necessary connection to any larger rationality, grabs upon
“following a rule” (a rule that helps to constitute one of these
language games) as a drowning man would a log. But for Oakeshott,
experience is at its root a “world of ideas,” and the only real
problem is how its original unity is splintered. As Boucher puts
it:
</p>

<p class="blockq">The point the idealists wanted to make… was that
the world is unintelligible without mind and that there is mutual
inclusivity. This mutual inclusivity can only be understood,
however, by rejecting the question of epistemology that arises when
we assume a duality between the mind and its objects. If we begin
by assuming that experience is an undifferentiated whole, then the
question becomes one of ontology, that is, how out of this unity do
we explain the multiplicity of modes of understanding... (2012:
54)
</p>


<h2>
<b>Following a Rule</b>
</h2>


<p>
As a result (I contend) of misunderstanding
Oakeshott’s metaphysics, Winch makes the following complaint about
Oakeshott‘s view of human activity: He admits that Oakeshott agrees
with his own understanding that principles, precepts, definitions, formulae—all derive
their sense from the context of human social activity in which they
are applied.” But he accuses Oakeshott of going too far in thinking
that “it follows from this that most human behaviour can be
adequately described in terms of the notion of habit or custom and
that neither the notion of a rule nor that of reflectiveness is
essential to it” (1990: 45).
</p>


<p>
We will take up the part rules play in
intelligent action in a moment, but first let us note that
Oakeshott, in his reply to Raphael, made it clear that he did not
view customary behavior as behavior from which reflection is
absent:
</p>

<p class="blockq">The view I ventured to suggest was that
explaining conduct... is a different activity from recommending
that a certain action should be performed or from approving or
disapproving of an action which has been performed. This, of
course, does not mean that reasoning is foreign to practical
discourse; it means only that the reasoning will be of a different
sort from explanatory reasoning... (2008: 181)
</p>


<p>
That Oakeshott did not mean by habit behavior is that it is completely
unreflective illustrated in the
following passages: being must be
recognized as one of the engagements of reflective consciousness,
and not as itself determinant of
reflective consciousness" (1975: 96–97).
The 'social being' behaving in a
traditional fashion is a creation of agency, and not vice versa:
<span class="s1">“</span>The contention that the substantive
performance of an agent is to be theorized in terms of his
<span class="s3">―</span>social being<span class="s1">‖</span>
makes sense only when <span class="s3">―</span>social
being<span class="s1">‖</span> is understood as his
self-recognition in being related to others in some particular
respect…” (1975: 98). And it is the actions of individuals that
create social practices: <span class="s1">“</span>Practices... are
footprints left behind by agents responding to their emergent
situations...” (1975: 100).
</p>


<p>
The rules Winch discusses can be used to
<i>explain</i> action, but most often are not the genuine basis for
decision-making. Simply because a rule can be <i>abstracted</i>
from some action does not mean it was the <i>basis</i> for it, any
more than the fact that a course on a map can be <i>abstracted</i>
from the migration of some birds mean that their migration was
<i>based</i> upon a course drawn on a map. Furthermore, as
MacIntyre noted, Winch‘s criterion of rule-following, which is that
there is a right way and a wrong way of doing the thing in
question, does not seem to apply to many conscious actions; as
MacIntyre asks, “Is there a wrong way of going for a walk?” (1973:
21)
</p>


<p>
Winch attempts to buttress his argument by
pointing to an alleged categorical distinction between human action
and animal behavior. We cannot, he contended, regard animals as
following rules in their behavior as we do with humans, except in
that we read their performances through the lens of humans‘
interest in training their animal charges to behave in a certain
fashion:
</p>

<p class="blockq">It is only the dog‘s relation to human beings
which makes it intelligible to speak of his having mastered a
trick; what this way of speaking amounts to could not be elucidated
by any description, however detailed, of canine behaviour in
complete isolation from human beings. (Winch, 1990: 57)
</p>


<p>
But this is sheer assertion on Winch’s part! He
continues, invoking Pavlov‘s famous experiments, to assert that
they demonstrate that “the dog has been <span class=
"s4">conditioned</span> to respond in a certain way” (1990: 58),
instead of displaying anything even resembling human understanding
of the situation it confronts. However, Winch seems to be
interpreting animal behavior by means of a mechanistic framework
that is not justified by the evidence, but is instead assumed as an
a priori truth. As Michael Polanyi notes, regarding Pavlov‘s
experiments:
</p>

<p class="blockq">the dog does not jump and snap at the bell as if
it were food, nor does a red light cause the kind of muscular
contraction which results from an electric shock... This entitles
us to say, in contrast to Pavlov‘s description of the process, that
in sign-learning the animal is taught to expect an event by
recognizing a sign foretelling the event. (Polanyi, 1962: 72)
</p>


<p>
Furthermore, it is well known that, for instance,
the behavior of birds in a flock can be understood by viewing them
as following certain, very simple rules, e.g., “Keep a constant
distance from your neighbor” but these behaviors are certainly not
something the birds have been trained to do by human beings! No,
the rule is <i>abstracted</i> from their actual behavior, just as
many of Winch’s rules are abstracted from human
behavior<span class="s1">.</span>
</p>


<p>
Winch goes on to accuse Oakeshott of
self-contradiction:
</p>

<p class="blockq">But human history is not just an account of
changing habits: it is the story of how men have tried to carry
over what they regard as important in their modes of behaviour in
to the new situations which they have had to face... Oakeshott‘s
attitude to reflectiveness is, as a matter of fact, incompatible
with a very important point which he makes early on in the
discussion. He says that the moral life is <span class=
"s5">“</span>conduct to which there is an alternative.” Now though
it is true that this “alternative” need not be consciously before
the agent‘s mind it must be something which <span class=
"s6">could</span> be brought before his mind... at least he must be
able to <i>understand</i> what it would have been like to act
differently. (Winch, 1990: 61)
</p>


<p>
But again, once it is understood that Oakeshott
readily acknowledges the importance of reflective thought in the
development of habits and customs, the appearance of
incompatibility between his endorsement of traditional practices as
a guide for human conduct and his understanding of morality as
inherently supposing alternatives to any morally laudatory choice
disappears. Furthermore, in what cultural setting, however
traditional, would it not be understood that things <i>could</i> be
done differently? Could we not bring it before the inhabitants’
minds what it would be to behave differently in any case? Only the
most isolated of peoples are not aware of the existence of other
cultures with different customs, widely criticized because while
“our” tribe <i>could</i> have done things that way, it is obviously
far inferior to the way we <i>actually</i> do things.
</p>


<p>
As noted in the introduction, in his “Preface to
the Second Edition,” Winch backs off on his claim about the
rule-governed nature of “truly human” activity a good deal, writing
“The kinds of relevance past experience has to current behaviour
can be brought out only in so far as that behaviour exemplifies
rules or is, in relevant respects, analogous to behaviour which
exemplifies rules” (1990: xvii). Behavior that is “analogous to
behaviour which exemplifies rules” is simply behavior from which a
rule might be abstracted. If the Winch of 1990 had revisited his
critique of Oakeshott, he might have found it melting away before
his eyes. But he did not: thus, this paper.
</p>


<h2>
<b>The Abstract and the Concrete</b>
</h2>


<p>
Behind Winch’s critique of Oakeshott, we might
detect the following notion: behavior is more fully human and
rational the more it adheres to abstract rules. While more
primitive, traditional mentality deals largely with the specifics
of its circumstances without formulating the universal, abstract
principles that provide the ultimate means of comprehending human
life, to the very extent that way of proceeding is replaced by more
abstract reasoning, it becomes more fully human. In fact, only
discursive, abstract thought, per Winch really qualifies as thought
at all: all else is mere “conditioning.” This attitude is quite
clear in Winch’s treatment of animal and traditional mentality: he
does not really see it as mentality at all.
</p>


<p>
However, R. G. Collingwood devised an ingenious
answer to such a line of reasoning, which, although he was working
in the context of theology, applies just as readily to practical
human action. Examining the idea that the Supreme Being ought to be
guided in its actions by abstract, universally valid rules, he
contends that, quite to the contrary, such abstractions are only of
use to beings unable to fully grasp the concrete details of
reality: “For a perfectly moral being, one who really appreciated
duty as such, these maxims and laws would recede into the
background and disappear; such a being simply ignores and does not
act on them at all, but acts merely on his intuition of duty”
(1994: 206). Or consider Bernard Bosanquet, writing in a similar
vein:
</p>

<p class="blockq">And we must have read Plato‘s <i>Philebus</i> and
Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i> to very little purpose if we do not
understand that, in principle, the fullest universal of character
and consciousness will embody itself in the finest and most
specialized and unrepeatable responses to environment; and that
life, and especially its intensified forms as morality or
knowledge, do not consist in observing general rules, but in
reacting adequately, with logical, that is, with fine and creative
adjustment to the ever-varying complexities of situations.
Precision, measurableness, and universal law, these are in the
moral act, but they are features of the solution of problems by
constructive organization, and not of obedience to abstract rule,
and the same thing is relatively true of the adjustments and
arrangements of a highly unified society. (Bosanquet, 1927:
105–106)
</p>


<p>
For the idealist, abstract thought is a
derivative and defective form of thought. As Collingwood stated
this:
</p>

<p class="blockq">The concept is not something outside the world of
sensuous experience: it is the very structure and order of that
world itself ... This is the point of view of concrete thought . .
. To abstract is to consider separately things that are
inseparable: to think of the universal, for instance, without
reflecting that it is merely the universal of its particulars, and
to assume that one can isolate it in thought and study it in this
isolation. This assumption is an error. One cannot abstract without
falsifying. (1924: 159–60)
</p>


<h2>
<b>Conclusion</b>
</h2>


<p>
Winch, in his critique of Oakehsott, failed to
realize that, as an idealist, Oakeshott held abstract, discursive
thought to be derivative of the world of concrete ideas. He
understood reality to be experience, and all experience to involve
some degree of understanding. As he says, “Experience is always and
everywhere a world of ideas. What is given in experience is a world
of ideas. But what is given is given always to be transformed…
Given a world of ideas, the end and achievement in experience is
that world made more of a world, made coherent” (1933: 48-49).
Missing this aspect of Oakeshott’s thought, Winch took “traditional
behaviour” to mean experience which was totally unreflective, which
Oakeshott would have held to be impossible. By failing to grasp the
philosophical underpinnings of the target of his critique, Winch’s
argument against Oakeshott missed its mark.
