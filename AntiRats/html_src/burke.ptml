            Abstract
            </h2>

        <p>
            The aim of this essay is to show that Burke’s criticism of French
            Enlightenment rationalism and the political theology of British
            revolutionary dissenters, like Priestley and Price, is not a form
            of irrational reactionary dogmatism. In this sense the chapter
            criticizes the picture painted of Burke by Strauss and others, and
            presents him rather as an enlightened and rational critic of
            dogmatic rationalism as a political ideology. Relying on such
            different interpreters of Burke as Pocock and Canavan, I argue two
            points:
        </p>

            <li>
            To show that Burke was in favor of a more realistic
            understanding of politics, as he thought that radical changes are
            not possible without even more radical risks.
            </li>
            <li>
            To argue that accepting this more realistic, skeptical account
            of the political possibilities of change, does not commit one to
            relativism, as far as the defense of basic values are concerned in
            politics.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The first point is argued with reference to Hume’s political
            skepticism, and the well-known analysis of the Scottish
            Enlightenment and Burke by Pocock. The paper acknowledges that those who
            claim that Burke comes close to the early modern discourse of
            reason of state have a point. Yet the present venture is dedicated
            to offer a more complex view of his position. Secondly, I argue
            that he in fact is not a relativist. This thesis is supported by
            Canavan’s Aristotelian-Ciceronian analysis of Burke. Burke’s
            skepticism about changing the world of politics is not value
            relativism, but a form of virtue, called by the ancient Romans as
            prudentia, by the Greek as phronesis, and it was carried over into
            Christian moral theory as a practical and intellectual virtue.What
            is more, Burke’s prudence can be interpreted as coming close to
            “reason of state” in international relations. Finally, this paper
            is going to show that the Burkean defense of prudence in politics
            is in fact laying the groundwork for the modern political
            philosophy of conservatism, as understood in the British context,
            consisting of such values as common sense, tradition and the rule
            of law, all of them compatible with political rationality.
