            <p>
            If "rationalism" refers to the thesis that there is a right way to
            do whatever it is that we do—a way that we, with our reason, can
            discover—then Ludwig Wittgenstein is a critic of rationalism. For
            our words and deeds are justified only by the rules of particular
            language-games—but these language-games are themselves justified
            only insofar as they meet our needs; certainly none of them need be
            justified by reference to any of the others. Together, our
            language-games constitute our form of life; though this form of
            life is not entirely arbitrary—some of its features can be
            explained by reference to our nature—nonetheless it could be
            different in many ways. Indeed, it has been—and therefore probably
            will be—different in many ways; on some level, we all know this.
            Philosophy at its worst is the attempt to forget it; philosophy at
            its best is, therefore, the attempt to remember it.
