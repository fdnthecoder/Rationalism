        Stuart Hampshire was an English philosopher associated with the group
        of thinkers often called ordinary language philosophers (e.g. J.L.
        Austin, P.F. Strawson, J.O. Urmson, et al.).  Like these other
        philosophers, Hampshire was skeptical of the scientistic reductionism
        characteristic of logical positivism.  In my essay, I will offer an
        account of the various aspects of Hampshire’s critique of enlightenment
        rationalism.  First, I will discuss Hampshire’s sympathetic but
        critical appraisal of Spinoza as the enlightenment philosopher <i>par
        excellence</i>.  Second I will elaborate Hampshire’s development of a
        pluralist epistemology which deploys a neo-Aristotelian distinction
        between scientific/theoretical reason and practical reason.  Third, and
        finally, I will examine Hampshire’s value pluralism, his emphasis on
        the ineluctability of moral conflict, and the consequent importance of
        political life in his work.
