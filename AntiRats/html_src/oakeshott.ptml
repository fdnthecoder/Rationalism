            Abstract
            </h2>

            <p>
                Oakeshott is known for a critique of modern Rationalism in
                politics and morals, an ideology which he says derives its
                inspiration from an exaggeration of the hopes for a universal
                method of Bacon and Descartes without the (occasional)
                skepticism of the latter.  In this paper, I try to accomplish
                the following: 1) give a concise statement of what Oakeshott
                means by “modern Rationalism;” 2) give a summary of his
                criticisms of it for its baleful effects in politics and
                morals; 3) show how Oakeshott’s criticisms of it for failing to
                respect the poetic or creative character of experiential
                reality are consistent with his philosophic positions in
                Experience and Its Modes (1933), as well as with his contingent
                preferences for civil association, understood as he understands
                it; and 4) give an assessment of the accuracy and
                reasonableness of Oakehsott’s analysis of, and alternatives to,
                modern Rationalism in politics and morals.
