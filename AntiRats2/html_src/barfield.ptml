            Metaphor, Meaning, and Mind:
            Knowledge and Imagination in Owen Barfield
        </h1>

        <p>
        The intellectual contributions of Owen Barfield are often overshadowed
        by the mammoth reputations of other prominent members of the Inklings,
        namely J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Scholarship primarily concerned
        with the work and thought of the Inklings during the 1930s and 40s in
        Oxford does indeed account for the enormous impact of Barfield, but his
        status is less assured beyond the circles of intellectual biography and
        literary criticism. Although Barfield's critique of enlightenment
        rationalism may be obvious among his intellectual biographers and
        enthusiasts of the Inklings' theological preoccupations and the
        aesthetics of their fantasy literature, this chapter attempts to
        introduce Barfield to scholars and readers concerned with the principal
        conversation of this volume and situate his wide-ranging body of
        thought within a larger context. Barfield's intellectual eclecticism
        bespeaks his concern to approach the social world from diverse angles,
        and his thought – from his advocacy for anthroposophy to his poetry –
        points to his aspiration to promote and elevate human consciousness and
        knowledge in a fashion that contradicted rationalism, among other
        problems that he saw as characterizing the modern condition, such as
        alienation. This chapter argues that Barfield's thought was a profound
        and unique contribution among the diversity of reactions to
        enlightenment rationalism.
