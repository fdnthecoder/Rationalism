<h2>
Abstract
</h2>

    <p>
    F. A. Hayek and Michael Oakeshott were two of the most prominent 
    20th century critics of what they referred to as "rationalism."
    The two thinkers knew each other personally, and read each other's work.
    So it would be easy to assume that, when each attacked rationalism,
    each was aiming his arrows at the same enemy.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But was this really the case?
    In this paper, I will argue that, in fact, Hayek and Oakeshott understood the 
    problem of rationalist thought quite differently.
    Furthermore, I contend, this difference is not a mere "brute fact," 
    but can be understood as based in their differing philosophical outlooks.
    </p>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

    <p>
    In the first half of the twentieth century,
    the rationalist tide had reached its high mark.
    The arts, child rearing, and business management were to be 
    revolutionized according to rationalist precepts.
    In architecture and city planning, rationalism would sweep away that 
    unnecessary clutter of old prejudices that restrained traditional 
    architecture and customary urban organization and build the modern, 
    functional buildings and communities that people truly needed.
    And, with the Soviet Union seen as setting the example,
    society as a whole was to be transformed into a 
    utopia by tossing aside all attachment to atavistic customs and 
    ancient moral relics and proceeding to design social 
    affairs from first principles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    But since then, the many disappointing outcomes of the rationalist program have 
    considerably dimmed its popularity.
    However, the evidence of those practical failures would not have been as 
    convincing as it was—perhaps it was the case that we just had not 
    found the proper rationalist program yet? -- if not for the existence 
    of a theoretical diagnosis of the malady.
    That diagnosis was provided by a number of theorists in the mid-twentieth century.
    This paper aims to compare and contrast the ideas 
    of two of those leading critics of rationalism, F. A. Hayek and Michael Oakeshott.
    While each of them certainly criticized "rationalism,"
    did each mean the same thing by it?
    In what senses did their analyses of the issue overlap,
    and in what senses did they differ?
    In this paper, I will argue that, in fact, Hayek and 
    Oakeshott understood the problem of rationalist thought quite differently.
    Furthermore, I contend, this difference is not a mere "brute fact,"
    but can be understood as based in their differing philosophical outlooks.
    Clarifying these issues should provide insights into this important topic.
    </p>

<h2>
Hayek and Oakeshott
</h2>

    <p>
    Hayek and Oakeshott have a curious intellectual relationship.
    Their backgrounds were fairly different: Hayek was an economist, 
    first made aware of the limits of rationalism through analyzing the 
    hurdles facing the central planner who was supposed to 
    rationally reorganize production in the socialist commonwealth.
    Oakeshott was trained as an historian, and launched his 
    investigations of rationalism from his study of philosophical idealism.
    Besides frequently being paired as major 20th-century critics of rationalism, 
    they also have in common long periods of employment at the 
    London School of Economics, as well as prominent places, 
    which perhaps neither desired, in the pantheon of modern conservative heroes.
    Nevertheless, the only references I have encountered by 
    Oakeshott to Hayek's work are his somewhat dismissive summary of 
    <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>, and a very sympathetic review of 
    <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>.
    Hayek praised Oakeshott, for example, in the introduction to 
    <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, but Hayek never, to my 
    knowledge, produced any in-depth commentary on
    the views of his purported counterpart.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Therefore, it may be useful to see what others have had to say about the
    relationship of Hayek's and Oakeshott's thought, before launching into our own
    analysis.
    </p>

<h3>
    Comparing Hayek and Oakeshott
</h3>

    <p>
    The initial impression one might adopt from seeing that both Hayek and
    Oakeshott criticize rationalism, and both regarded neutral rules important
    to civil society, is that they were saying essentially the same thing,
    perhaps merely using slightly different terms. Boyd and Morrison (2007)
    adopt this line, noting the preference of both thinkers for "spontaneous
    orders." But the very phrase they use to connect the two in the title of
    their paper might give us pause, since Oakeshott
    never used the term "spontaneous order."
    </p>

    <p>
    Kenneth Minogue understood that there was a significant
    difference between Hayek and Oakeshott on this matter,
    which he summed up as follows:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    How might we formulate the difference between Hayek and Oakeshott? Let me
    suggest that it might be done in terms of levels of scepticism. At the
    least sceptical level, the socialist actually believes that revolutionary
    upheaval, or some plan of social engineering, can save the world. The
    twentieth century was full of such moths who found the flames of
    abstraction irresistible, and many perished as a result. We are far from
    having done away with their successors. Against this kind of thing, Hayek‘s
    sceptical account of an economy as a ‘discovery procedure’ was
    an exhilarating illumination of what socialist melodramas of oppression had
    obscured. A society whose power was dispersed among all its individuals was
    the epitome of freedom. It was also, as Hayek perhaps at times
    overemphasized, the epitome of prosperity. At the level of proposals to
    engineer society so as to remove the disharmonies of inequality, Hayek‘s
    scepticism was in good working order. It was not, however, a scepticism
    about abstract proposals in general, and it was on this point that the
    Oakeshott-Hayek disagreement emerged. Oakeshott‘s scepticism is a
    philosophical distancing from any form of human folly. He interprets the
    Hobbesian account of Christianity in particular as dealing (as he puts it)
    with ‘the local and transitory mischief in which the universal predicament
    of mankind appeared’ in his time. Hayek is too close to the mischief to
    recognize the universal predicament. (2002)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    But the most important precursor of this paper is Chor-yung Cheung's (2014)
    "The Critique of Rationalism and the Defense of Individuality: Oakeshott and Hayek."
    In it, he presents a keenly insightful analysis
    of how Oakeshott's understanding of rationalism differs from Hayek's.
    In fact, his analysis is close enough to that offered in this paper that,
    were it not for the fact that he never explicitly identifies the basis of
    the differences he highlights, this paper would not have been written.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cheung begins by noting that Hayek and
    Oakeshott share "the preference for emerging 
    practices to deliberately designed institutions" (3): thus, the common
    albeit superficial impression that the two must be talking about pretty much
    the same thing. Nevertheless, he continues,
    "there are important differences between the two as regards the respective
    critiques of Rationalism..." (4)
    </p>

    <p>
    In fact, Oakeshott's claim about Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, that "A plan
    to resist all planning maybe better than its opposite, but it belongs to
    the same style of politics," is correct. As Cheung puts it,
    Hayek is "employing an ideology... or a doctrine derived from abstract
    political principles to defend individual freedom and Western civilization"
    (4).
    </p>

    <p>
    "The problem with Rationalism, according to Oakeshott, is that it does not
    recognize practical knowledge is knowledge at all, and it asserts that only
    technical knowledge is rational..." (4) As though Hayek were 
    seeking to illustrate this problem, Cheung quotes him claiming 
    "one should not 'disdain to seek assistance from whatever
    nonrational institutions or habits have proven their worth'" (5).
    The difference here is that Hayek, despite his critique of what he sees as
    'rationalism,' still accepts the rationalist's erroneous claim that only
    abstract reasoning is rational, while practical knowledge is "nonrational."
    </p>

    <p>
    Cheung illustrates Oakeshott's view using the particular example of
    morality:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    Oakeshott tries to show that while the dominant reflective mode of
    morality in the West appears to be very self conscious, rational and
    scientific, reality, it is abstract, detach from the concrete data de
    traditional moral habits, unstable and dogmatic...
    "if we use these abstracted principles as the supreme guides for our moral
    conduct, this is... putting the cart before the horse, because these
    principles are would have been distilled from the actual concrete
    practices, without which they will lose most of their meanings. (5)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Cheung indicates Hayek's mistake in thinking that we are "unconsciously
    following a rule" in activites like riding a bicycle or playing billiards,
    without quite being able to put his finger on what exactly the mistake is:
    "but it is not entirely clear in what sense riding a bicycle should be
    understood as following the laws of mechanics" (6).
    </p>

    <p>
    Cheung comes perilously close to obviating the need for this paper when he
    notes that "Hayek's philosophical perspective it is very likely blind to a
    lot of the things that Oakeshott has said regarding the poetic character of
    human activity" (7). But he never makes explicit what it is that is
    different between Hayek's philosophical perspective and Oakeshott's.
    And thus, the remained of this paper, which will proceed by turning first
    to Hayek on rationalism.
    </p>

<h2>
Hayek on Rationalism
</h2>

    <p>
    Hayek's philosophy, while never articulated at great length, 
    appears to have been a variety of "emergent phenomena" materialism.
    In his view, reason was not an aspect of human activities in general, 
    but only emerged in the process of abstracting from "sensory input" 
    any number of scientific laws, legal rules, heuristics for 
    deciding on practical courses of action, and so on.
    Working from this base, Hayek criticized "rationalism" as a 
    failure to recognize how limited reason is in its application.
    The "abuse of reason" consists in trying to use our 
    rationality to direct irrational (or, at best, "ecologically rational") 
    processes it cannot fully grasp, such as the historical development of 
    our customs, norms, conventions and institutions.
    For Hayek, particular, historical situations cannot be rationally understood, 
    since, for him, reason is identical to "abstract thought." 
    Hayek did famously stress the importance of knowledge of 
    "the particular circumstances of time and place" 
    ("The Use of Knowledge in Society"), but it is unclear how his 
    epistemology makes such knowledge possible.
    </p>

    <h3>
        The Knowledge Essays
    </h3>
    
        <p>
        Hayek first began moving away from technical economics and into broader
        issues of social philosophy with his justly famed essays, "Economics
        and Knowledge" (1937) and "The Use of Knowledge in Society" (1945).
        In the first of these essays, Hayek recognizes the limitations of the
        abstractions of formal economic analysis:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote> 
        Indeed my main contention
        will be that the tautologies, of which formal equilibrium analysis in
        economics essentially consists, can be turned into propositions which
        tell us anything about causation in the real world only in so far as we
        are able to fill those formal propositions with definite statements
        about how knowledge is acquired and communicated. (1937: 3.1)
        </blockquote> 

        <blockquote>
            In the usual presentations of equilibrium analysis it is generally
            made to appear as if these questions of how the equilibrium comes
            about were solved. But if we look closer it soon becomes evident
            that these apparent demonstrations amount to no more than the
            apparent proof of what is already assumed.*42 The device generally
            adopted for this purpose is the assumption of a perfect market
            where every event becomes known instantaneously to every member. It
            is necessary to remember here that the perfect market which is
            required to satisfy the assumptions of equilibrium analysis must
            not be confined to the markets of all the individual commodities;
            the whole economic system must be assumed to be one perfect market
            in which everybody knows everything. The assumption of a perfect
            market then means nothing less than that all the members of the
            community, even if they are not supposed to be strictly omniscient,
            are at least supposed to know automatically all that is relevant
            for their decisions. (1937: 3.22)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        The Use of Knowledge in Society
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order
            is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the
            circumstances of which we must make use never exists in
            concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of
            incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the
            separate individuals possess. (H.3)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            It will at once be evident that on this point the position will be
            different with respect to different kinds of knowledge; and the
            answer to our question will therefore largely turn on the relative
            importance of the different kinds of knowledge; those more likely
            to be at the disposal of particular individuals and those which we
            should with greater confidence expect to find in the possession of
            an authority made up of suitably chosen experts. If it is today so
            widely assumed that the latter will be in a better position, this
            is because one kind of knowledge, namely, scientific knowledge,
            occupies now so prominent a place in public imagination that we
            tend to forget that it is not the only kind that is relevant. (H.8)
         </blockquote>

         <blockquote>
             Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific knowledge is
             not the sum of all knowledge. But a little reflection will show
             that there is beyond question a body of very important but
             unorganized knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific
             in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the knowledge of the
             particular circumstances of time and place. (H.9)
         </blockquote>

         <p>
            In the above passage, Hayek nearly hits upon the idea of the
            "concrete universal."
         </p>

         <blockquote>
             We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any
             occupation after we have completed our theoretical training, how
             big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs,
             and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of
             people, of local conditions, and of special circumstances. (H.9)
         </blockquote>

         <blockquote>
             It is a curious fact that this sort of knowledge should today be
             generally regarded with a kind of contempt and that anyone who by
             such knowledge gains an advantage over somebody better equipped
             with theoretical or technical knowledge is thought to have acted
             almost disreputably. (H.10)
         </blockquote> 

    <h3>
        The Sensory Order
    </h3>
    
        <p>
        In <i>The Sensory Order</i>, Hayek tries to depict how thought itself, 
        which for him means abstract thought, can arise
        from entirely thoughtless processes.
        But he has left himself here a conundrum that I suggest is 
        impossible to solve: How in the world can any sensible abstraction 
        be drawn from a welter of particulars that are, in and of themselves, 
        not susceptible to being understood?
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Hayek, in this work, explicitly contends that
        the concrete is dependent upon the abstract:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote> 
            The continuous presence, while consciousness lasts
            Of these mental contents of a most abstract character,
            representing the spatial and temporal structure of 
            the environment, is not always recognized.
            This is probably due to the preconception that concrete 
            perceptions always precedes the more abstract mental contents.
            There can be little doubt, however, that the distinct conscious 
            picture of particular phenomena is always embedded, 
            or surrounded by a semi conscious and more shadowy 
            outline of the rest of the surroundings..." (2014: 138)
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>
        Hayek's thought runs aground in this regard because he had 
        not recognized the significance of the revolution in philosophy 
        initiated by Hegel: he had not grasped
        the idea of the "concrete universal." 
        On the other hand, Oakeshott's critique of rationalism
        is based upon that very concept.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Hayek's Critique of Conservatism
        </h3>
        
        <p class="first_par">Hayek's essay "Why I Am Not a Conservative," 
        which was published as a postscript in <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>, 
        can be taken as an implicit criticism of Oakeshott.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Hayek opens by acknowledging the virtue he 
        detects in the conservative political stance, writing:
        "Conservatism proper is a legitimate, probably necessary, 
        and certainly widespread attitude of opposition to drastic change.
        It has, since the French Revolution, for a century and a half 
        played an important role in European politics" (1960: 397)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Despite this acknowlegement, he has only "two cheers" for conservatism, 
        as he continues:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>Let me now state what seems to me the decisive 
        objection to any conservatism which deserves to be called such.
        It is that by its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the 
        direction in which we are moving.
        It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies in 
        slowing down undesirable developments, but, since it does not 
        indicate another direction, it cannot prevent their continuance.
        It has, for this reason, invariably been the fate of conservatism 
        to be dragged along a path not of its own choosing.
        The tug of war between conservatives and progressives 
        can only affect the speed, not the direction, of contemporary developments.
        But, though there is a need for a 'brake on the vehicle of progress', 
        I personally cannot be content with simply helping to apply the brake.
        (1960: 398)
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        In what might plausibly read as a direct criticism of Oakeshott,
        Hayek contends:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>This brings me to the first point on which the 
        conservative and the liberal dispositions differ radically.
        As has often been acknowledged by conservative writers, one of the 
        fundamental traits of the conservative attitude is a fear of change, 
        a timid distrust of the new as such, while the liberal position is 
        based on courage and confidence, on a preparedness to let change 
        run its course even if we cannot predict where it will lead.
        There would not be much to object to if the conservatives merely 
        disliked too rapid change in institutions and public policy;
        here the case for caution and slow process is indeed strong.
        But the conservatives are inclined to use the powers of government 
        to prevent change or to limit its rate to
        whatever appeals to the more timid mind.
        (1960: 400)
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        Hayek, in the above passage, could be seen as raising the following question
        for Oakeshott: how can looking merely to the "intimations" of existing
        practice avoid providing justificatory cover for some fundamentally unjust
        political regime?
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            Law, Legislation and Liberty
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        Nevertheless, Hayek's thought grew closer to Oakeshott's over time,
        to the extent that his three-volume work from the 1970s,
        <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, often reads like an expansion
        of Oakeshott's essays on rationalism, and posits a key distinction
        between 'spontaneous orders' and 'organizations' that closely 
        parallels Oakeshott's between 'civil' and 'enterprise' associations.
        He seems particularly close to Oakeshott, for instance, when he writes:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>The first view holds that human institutions will serve human 
        purposes only if they have been deliberately designed for these 
        purposes, often also that the fact that an institution exists is 
        evidence of its having been created for a purpose, and always that we 
        should so re-design society and its institutions that all our actions 
        will be wholly guided by known purposes.
        To most people these propositions seem almost self-evident and to 
        constitute a attitude alone worthy of a thinking being.
        Yet the belief underlying them, that we all owe all beneficial 
        institutions to design, and that only such design has made or can make them 
        useful for our purposes, is largely false.
        (1973: 8-9)
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        And also when he says:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>Yet the basic assumption underlying the belief that man has 
        achieved mastery of his surroundings mainly through his capacity for 
        logical deduction from explicit premises is factually false, 
        and any attempt to confine his actions to what could thus be 
        justified would deprive him of many of the most effective means to 
        success that have been available to him.
        It is simply not true that our actions owe their 
        effectiveness solely or chiefly to the knowledge which we can 
        state in words and which can therefore constitute the 
        explicit premises of a syllogism.
        (1973: 11)
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
        However, even at this stage of his thought, Hayek was still, despite his 
        critique of what he calls 'constructivist rationalism', proposing 
        abstract rules to fix the problem.
        And so Hayek writes, 'That freedom can be preserved 
        only if it is treated as a supreme principle which must not 
        be sacrificed for particular advantages was fully understood by the 
        leading liberal thinkers of the nineteenth century...' (1973: 72), 
        and one realizes there is something significantly different
        from Oakeshott is going on here.
        Taleb notes the unresolved tension in Hayek's view: "We may... think that... 
        Hayek would be in the antifragile, antirationalist category... 
        But Hayek missed the notion of optionality..." (2014: 258).

        Or, as Rowland wrote:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            On the one hand, Hayek appears to evaluate institutions 
        according to whether they are the products of spontaneous evolution;
        liberty and order, he suggests, are a product of such evolutionary processes.
        On the other hand, his development of a model constitution appears to 
        demonstrate his willingness to engage in rational design, exactly the 
        process his traditionalism argues against.

            The Fatal Conceit
        </h3>

        <p>
        In <i>The Fatal Conceit</i>. Hayek's last work published before his
        death, he introduces the idea of <i>group selection</i> into his
        corpus. Here, we find a notion of "rationality" completely disconnected
        from any idea that the actors engaged in this "rational" behavior have
        any thoughts about how their behavior "makes sense" at all. Their
        patterns of behavior may be completely opaque to the actors themselves,
        yet they exhibit what Vernon Smith (2010) terms "ecological
        rationality": in this construct, the behavior of the "agents" involved
        in an activity can be completely mindless, but it is termed "rational"
        because, to an outside observer, an "aim" can be assigned to this
        pattern of activity, which, despite not being the aim of
        any agent actually engaged in the activity,
        nevertheless makes the activity seem sensible to the observer.
        </p>

        <p>
        But this sort of "rationality" renders the idea of "rational action"
        vacuous: if an outcome is not intended by any agent involved in
        achieving it, why in the world is their behavior deemed "rational"
        simply because a theorist, judging from outside the realm of their
        activities, deems that outcome satifactory according to his theory? By
        this criterion, a physicist could declare that electrons are
        "rationally" orbiting atomic nucleii, since he is in possesion of a
        theory that explains why they are doing so.

<h2>
    Oakeshott on Rationalism
</h2>

    <p>
    For Oakeshott, the problem is not that our reason is not up to the job of
    grappling with our practical affairs, including those of our political life.
    Instead, as he points out in <i>Experience and Its Modes</i>,
    the world of practice is itself a world of ideas.
    Concrete reality is, in and of itself, comprehensible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Thus when Oakeshott attacks rationalism, he
    is not claiming that it is a case of 
    reason going beyond its limits, as Hayek does.
    Instead, rationalism for Oakeshott is the attempt to replace practical reason 
    (phronesis) with abstract, theoretical reason (theoria).
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
    The central thesis of this paper is that the difference here between Hayek and
    Oakeshott turns crucially on Oakeshott's heritage of British idealist thought.
    For example, here is R. G. Collingwood expressing the idealist emphasis on
    the concrete:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
    The concept it's not something outside the world of sensuous experience:
    it is the very structure in order of that world itself...
    This is the point of view of concrete thought...
    Too abstract is to consider separately things that are inseparable:
    to think of the universal, for instance, without reflecting that it is
    merely the universal of its particulars,
    and to assume that one can isolate it in thought and to 
    study it in this isolation. This assumption is an error. (1924)
    </blockquote>
    
    <p> 
    In shorter form, Bernard Bosanquet wrote:
    "the fullest universal of character and consciousness will
    embody itself in the finest and most specialized and
    unrepeatable responses to environment." (1927)
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For the British Idealists, abstract reasoning was not reasoning itself, which
    had to be opposed by some sort of "instinctual," anti-rational reliance on
    evolution to sort things out. Instead, abstract reasoning is always a partial
    and therefore defective (although perhaps very useful!) form of reason, and
    concrete reason is always its superior. And Hayek does not grapple with this
    concept of reason at all.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Experience and Its Modes
    </h3>
        
        <p>
        Published in 1933, this book is a defense of philosophical idealism. 
        In it, Oakeshott argues that only philosophy represents 
        'experience without reservation or arrest' (1933: 4),
        a view he would modify in later works, but never entirely abandon.
        Other 'modes of experience,' such as science, history, and practice, are
        inherently partial forms of understanding, as they arise from
        particular presuppositions, which they leave unquestioned, that form
        these 'worlds of ideas'. This intrinsic conditionality means that these
        modes of experience not only fall short of
        grappling with the 'totality of experience',
        but also makes them categorically distinct.
        Each mode is constituted by its own presuppositions, so that no
        mode is in a position to dictate the understanding achieved by any of the
        others.  For this paper, what is most relevant is Oakeshott's claim that
        science has no authority over practice.  Per Oakeshott, the rationalists'
        dream of reorganizing and improving the 'irrational' world of practice,
        grounded in tradition, by applying abstract,
        scientific principles to everyday
        conduct, is guilty of categorical irrelevance. Science, as Oakeshott explains,
        is an 'attempt to find... a world of definite and demonstrable experience, one
        free from merely personal associations and independent of the idiosyncrasies of
        particular observers, an absolutely impersonal and stable world' (1933:
        169–170). As such, the 'concepts [of science] do not, 
        in any sense, refer to the world of practice, to the world
        given in sensation [and therefore,] the generalizations which express their
        necessary relations cannot be taken to imply that any event or occurrence will
        invariably take place. The concepts do not refer to events;
        and the generalizations are not in respect of events' (1933: 183).
        </p>

        <p>
        In the world of practice, on the other hand, experience is understood in
        terms of how a current state of affairs might be transformed into a future
        state understood to be more satisfactory to a specific agent. As such, 'a
        scientific idea must be transformed, taken out of the world of scientific
        experience, before it can establish itself in the world of practice' (1933:
        265). For example, an engineer in his work cannot simply employ the laws of
        physics as they are given to him by physicists;
        in trying to solve a
        practical problem like designing a building, he must recast
        those laws in terms of concepts foreign to physics,
        as he seeks not universal laws, but to determine, for instance,
        'Will this particular building, built as designed at this particular
        location, provide an adequate safety margin for this particular predicted
        earthquake level and these particular wind shears
        while meeting this particular cost constraint?' 
        Those specifics, the inclusion of which 
        is vital for any successful solution to
        the engineer's problem, are categorically excluded from properly scientific
        laws. Given the divergent aims characterizing the modes of science and of
        practice, the scientist is no more in a position to dictate the course of
        practical affairs according to his theoretical conclusions than is the
        practical person in a position to direct scientific research according to her
        personal ambitions. The relevance of this early conclusion of Oakeshott's to
        his later essays on rationalism is, I think, obvious, especially once it is
        recognized that the proper contrast class to rational
        politics is not "traditional politics," as Hayek's "Why I Am Not a
        Conservative" essay miht suggest, but practical politics.

        idealism without overturning it, see, for instance,

        understood to have left the idealism of his youth behind, see Gerencser (2000).

        events that is supportive of Oakeshott's, see Cartwright (1983).)

    <h3>
        Rationalism Essays
    </h3>

        <p>
        It has not been generally recognized that Oakeshott's most recognized work, on
        rationalism in politics and in conduct, follows directly from the philosophical
        ideas put forward in <i>Experience and Its Modes</i>. The rationalist
        misapplies the standards of one mode (theoretical science) in another mode
        (practice) where they are categorically irrelevant.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As Oakeshott saw it, the rationalist believes
        that every essential aspect of any human practice can be conveyed
        adequately by means of a 'guidebook' comprising explicitly stated rules,
        formalized technical procedures, and general, abstract principles. 
        The rationalist view is that arriving at the correct theory on some
        subject is all that is required to achieve successful performances in its
        domain; indeed, attending to any anything else, such as long-standing traditions,
        is a positive barrier to success in a field.
        What is necessary to be 'rational' is to approach any activity
        with a tabula rasa upon which the correct technique for that activity can be
        cleanly inscribed; as Oakeshott put it, in this view, rational conduct involves
        'a certain emptying of the mind, a conscious effort
        to get rid of preconceptions' (1991
        [1962]: 101).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Quite to the contrary of that understanding of the relationship between
        technical guidelines and tacit knowledge, Oakeshott argues that the
        rationalist, in awarding theory primacy over practice, has gotten things
        exactly backwards.
        
        Theoretical understanding is always a
        by-product of practical skill: we come to understand the general and abstract
        only through understanding the concrete and particular, i.e., the concrete
        universal.
        
        In fact, Oakeshott sees
        the dependence of theory upon practice as being so unavoidable that
        not only is the rationalist incapable of successful performances guided solely
        by a theoretical model of the activity to be performed, he is not able to
        stick to his purported guidelines at all:
        instead, he will fall back on some existing practice 
        instead of actually following the abstraction that supposedly guides his
        conduct.  Oakeshott's point here is close to
        Wittgenstein's on "following a rule":
        at some point we have to go without rules 
        and just know what we are doing as part of a way of life, as otherwise 
        we need an infinite regress of rules: meta-rules to tell us how to follow the
        first level rules, and meta-meta-rules to tell us how to follow them, and so
        on. (See Wittgenstein, 1953: 85-86.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        However, Oakeshott‘s assertion that the rationalist never really can proceed
        according to her avowed principles does not mean that her attempt to adhere to
        them will be inconsequential, but only that it will not succeed. An analogy may
        be helpful here: A person trying to become a parrot by strapping on wings and a
        beak and some colorful feathers won't become one, but they will make themselves
        look ridiculous and hamper their day-to-day activities. As Collingwood wrote,
        'A person may think he is a poached egg; that will not make him one: but it will
        affect his conduct, and for the worse‘ (1924: 206). That is the point Franco
        was making in noting that 'an erroneous theory can have pernicious practical
        consequences‘ (2004: 93). Since the pronouncements of the rationalist disparage
        current practices, customs, and morals, insofar as they do not follow from his
        rational deliberations about how his society ought to be ordered, they will
        erode the spontaneous ease of the communal life that those traditions
        nourished, while offering in its stead only the artificial routines and
        regulations of a 'rational‘ bureaucracy, or worse. Oakeshott offered this
        example: 'First, we do our best to destroy parental authority (because of its
        alleged abuse), then we sentimentally deplore scarcity of good homes, and we
        end by creating substitutes which complete the work of destruction‘ (1991
        [1962]: 41). Traditional ways are undermined further by the rationalist fantasy
        that social perfection is a realistic goal, so that any practice promoting
        social order, however workable it might have proved in the past, will be
        condemned as an atavistic relic standing in the path of progress for failing to
        have brought about utopia.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        It does not follow, from Oakeshott‘s view of the rationalist project as
        ruinously misguided, that all traditional practices are sacrosanct, or even
        that they all are laudable. Traditions are like living organisms: both can
        suffer illnesses and other disabilities;
        both ought to and usually do learn and
        adapt in response to their external circumstances and internal tensions; or,
        failing to do so, both soon cease to exist. But those adaptations, if they are
        to successfully meet the challenges presented by novel situations, must not
        promote the deterioration of the very organic order they purport to be serving.
        An appreciation for such evolutionary adaptation does not entail denying that
        intellectual criticism of the present social order has a genuine and vital role
        to play in that process. The political theorist can serve to diagnose and treat
        ills in his polity much as a physician does with those ills he detects in his
        patients. But, as Oakeshott noted, 'to cure is not to transform, it is not to
        turn the patient into a different sort of being;
        it is to restore to him such
        health as he is naturally capable of enjoying' (2006: 114). Because the
        rationalist physician attempts to transform rather than merely heal his charge,
        his treatments are likely to do far more harm than good.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Unfortunately, the 'rationalist chef's' counterpart in social reform similarly
        is inclined to interpret the social maladies produced by his projects not as
        evidencing any problem with his modus operandi but, quite to the contrary, as
        signaling the need for an even more energetic and thorough implementation of
        rationalist social engineering. The engineering metaphor itself encourages the
        planners to regard the rest of the citizenry as parts of a machine, cogs to be
        readjusted and rearranged as called for by each new blueprint, each drawn up to
        fix the problems generated by its predecessor. Since most people are
        disinclined to acquiesce to a life in which they are constrained to behave as
        an externally controlled mechanical device, the breakdown of each new,
        rationalist design for society is made even more probable.

    <h3>
        On Human Conduct
    </h3>
    
        <p>
        In <i>On Human Conduct</i>, published in 1975, Oakeshott presents
        another pair of dichotomous ideal types, the first of which is that of
        the practitioner and the theorist;
        indeed, his previously cited remark, made
        while responding to critics of this book, that he had abandoned his earlier use
        of 'tradition' as an apt term for the style of politics he opposed to
        rationalism, was the basis for our adopting 'practical politics' as superior to
        the perhaps more common 'traditional politics' for designating that style.
        Oakeshott opens this work with a lengthy meditation on the nature of
        theorizing. As he concludes that section, he segues into the discussion of the
        practice/theory dichotomy by noting the debt his analysis of theorizing owes to
        Plato's examination of the same topic, especially to the metaphor of the cave
        presented in The Republic. In light of the similarity of their views, Oakeshott
        continued, 'it may be instructive to notice [our] divergencies' (1975: 27). And
        indeed it may.
        </p>

        <p>
        As Oakeshott understood Plato, the latter's cave dwellers represent those
        individuals whose conceptual horizon is bound within the world
        of practical affairs. Plato was correct, in Oakeshott's view, in holding that,
        because such individuals fail to recognize the intrinsically conditional nature
        of the practical understanding of reality, instead mistakenly accepting it as
        the only possible mode of comprehending experience so that, however clever and
        adept they become at dealing with the practical world, they have, in effect,
        imprisoned themselves within its confines (i.e., within Plato's cave). As Corey
        wrote of Oakeshott's understanding of the conditional nature of practical
        experience, 'Nowhere in practice is there uninterrupted progress or final
        achievement... If human life were to consist wholly in engagement in practical
        affairs, then it would seem to be a depressing predicament' (2006: 39). And
        Plato also was accurate in regarding the understanding of the theorist, in that
        it represents at least a recognition of those limitations, as being, in a
        sense, a higher form of knowledge than that gained by the solely practical
        thinker.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, Oakeshott argued, 'distracted by his exclusive concern with the
        engagement of theoretical understanding and with the manifest shortcomings of
        [the cave-dwellers' world]... [Plato] is disposed to write [the latter] off as
        nescience. This, I think, is a mistake' (1975: 27). That the practical
        understanding of the world is inherently limited does not imply that what it
        yields it is not really knowledge at all;
        rather, the proper conclusion is that
        practical understanding offers only a conditional form of knowledge—but
        conditional knowledge is nevertheless knowledge, and not mere ignorance.
        Moreover, quite crucially for Oakeshott, the abstract superiority of
        theoretical knowledge over its practical counterpart in no way means that the
        former can replace the latter in dealing with the practical world, which is,
        after all, precisely the conditional realm for which practical understanding is
        the appropriate species of knowledge. While it is true that discovering 'a
        platform of understanding is conditional and to become acquainted with its
        proximate conditions is a notable step in the engagement of understanding',
        such a discovery 'is not like exposing a fraud [, since] shadows are not
        forgeries' (1975: 28).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Given that genuine knowledge of the realm of the shadows is a real and hard-won
        achievement, the 'pure' theorist goes gravely astray if he erroneously employs
        his theoretical insights as grounds for issuing directives to accomplished
        practitioners, ridiculously trying to 'set them straight' on matters with which
        the theorist has no familiarity. Oakeshott wryly noted:
        </p>

        <blockquote> 
        The cave-dwellers, upon first encountering the theorist after his return to the
        world of the shadows [very well might be impressed] when he
        tells them that what they had always thought of as 'a horse' is not what they
        suppose it to be... but is, on the contrary, a modification of the attributes
        of God [, and they will] applaud his performance even where they cannot quite
        follow it. [The cave-dwellers can appreciate the exotic pronouncements of the
        theorist, as long as he confines those pronouncements to their genuine field of
        applicability.] But if he were to tell them that, in virtue of his more
        profound understanding of the nature of horses, he is a more expert horse-man,
        horse-chandler, or stable boy than they (in their ignorance) could ever hope to
        be, and when it becomes clear that his new learning has lost him the ability to
        tell one end of a horse from the other... [then] before long the more
        perceptive of the cave-dwellers [will] begin to suspect that, after all, he
        [is] not an interesting theorist but a fuddled and pretentious 'theoretician'
        who should be sent on his travels again, or accommodated in a quiet home.
        (1975: 30)
        </blockquote> 
        
        <p>
        The preceding passage from <i>On Human Conduct</i>
        provides a fresh perspective from
        which we can contemplate the character of the rationalist and perceive how it
        is that he has gone astray. Here, the modern rationalist is understood as an
        imperialist 'theoretician' who is repeating Plato's ancient misstep.
        Furthermore, Oakeshott now offers a more sympathetic picture of the rationalist
        than did his earlier, more polemical essays—the reader can appreciate how easy
        it is to fall into the error of rationalism, since the theorist really has
        broken through to a higher form of knowledge, and it is quite understandable
        that, elated by his achievement, he mistakenly concludes that theory ought to
        be the unquestioned master of practice, failing to realize that the
        fundamentally different presuppositions of theoretical and practical thought
        render theoretical findings categorically irrelevant to practical matters,
        unless they are translated from their native idiom into that of practice.
        </p>

    <h3>
        On History
    </h3>
    
        <p>
            <i>On History</i> is most significant for our purposes in that it
            thoroughly refutes writers such as Gerencser (2000) who
            contend that Oakeshott had at some point abandoned idealism for
            skepticism. For instance, right at the beginning of the work, we find
            Oakeshott declaring:
        </p>
    
        <blockquote> 
            By the modality of an enquiry I mean the conditions of relevance that
            constitute it a distinct kind of enquiry and distinguish it both from
            an inconsequential groping around in the 
            confusion of all the maybe going on and from similarly
            distinct enquiries but of other kinds. These conditions of relevance
            are of course formal, but where there are none, where there is no
            specifiable modality, there can be no enquiry and so no consequential
            conclusions.

            A mode of understanding, then, is not merely an attitude or a point of
            view. It is an autonomous manner of understanding, specifiable in
            terms of exact conditions, which is logically incapable of denying
            or confirming the conclusions of any other mode of understanding, or
            indeed of making any relevant utterance in respective of it. (1999:
            2-3)

            This is, of course, just the understanding of modality Oakeshott had
            forwarded five decades earlier. these two paragrpahs could be inserted
            at various points in <i>Experience and Its Modes</i> without changing
            that work's argument at all. Thus, we see that the authors who wish to
            create an "idealist Oakeshott" and a later "skeptical Oakeshott" are
            merely projecting their own skepticism onto a writer who at times
            agrees with their point of view. In other wordss, they are skeptics,
            and they wish to discover a skeptical Oakeshott, and so they do.

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>

    <p>
    The key to understanding why, despite the apparent similarity of their
    critiques of rationalism, Hayek and Oakeshott actually differ significantly
    in their prescriptions lies,
    as mentioned above, in the fact that Oakeshott
    was an idealist while Hayek was not.
    Since for Oakeshott the world is a world of ideas,
    the concrete is inherently intelligible in and of its self.
    For Hayek, on the other hand, what is opposed to
    abstract thought is not concrete thought,
    but instinct, mechanism, or emotion.
    Writing of Hegel's statement that 'the view which
    clings to abstraction is liberalism,
    over which the concrete always prevails...' Hayek contends
    'he truly described the fact that we are not yet mature enough to submit 
    for any length of time to strict discipline of reason and allow our 
    emotions to constantly break through its restraints' (1973: 33),
    he fails to understand that for Hegel, as
    for most of the Idealists who followed him,
    concrete thought was the <i>telos</i> of reason, and not a fall from it.
    Hayek believes that the relationships that make up his 'Great Society'
    are abstract because the <i>theory</i> of such relationships is highly abstract;
    but those relationships themselves are concrete:
    <i>this</i> businessman buys <i>this</i> amount of concrete from
    <i>this</i> vendor to be delivered at <i>this</i> time and <i>this</i> place.
    For Hayek, trying to intelligently decide policies on a case-by-case
    basis will only result in irrational, emotional interventions that
    eventually will lead us down 'the road to serfdom';
    only a dogmatic insistence on classical liberal principles can preserve freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
    In short, for Hayek, the rationalist is one who does not realize that
    the single tool human reason possesses, that of abstract, theoretical reasoning,
    is not up to all tasks to which it has been assigned.
    To the contrary, Oakeshott argues that the problem itself stems from
    believing that there <i>is</i> only one tool available to human reason.
    The rationalist is in the position of someone using a hand saw to cut the lawn.
    But the lawnmower -- in our metaphor, concrete reason -- 
    exists, and once its existence is recognized, we can address the practical
    problems of the world reasonably, and not as abstractions.
