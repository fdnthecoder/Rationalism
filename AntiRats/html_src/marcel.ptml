        <p>
            This chapter surveys Gabriel Marcel’s critique of technocratic
            rationalism.  An important figure in French existentialism, Marcel
            (1889-1973) did not deny the benefits of technological progress.
            He did worry, though, that a technical ethos was reshaping how we
            see the world and ourselves.  He especially worried about a
            tendency to reduce mysteries to problems.  A problem, for Marcel,
            is something external to us that can be determinatively understood
            and solved with a generalizable technique. A mystery, on the other
            hand, is something in which we are inextricably involved. It has
            roots deep within us, but it also reaches beyond us. While a
            problem can be definitively solved, a mystery can only be navigated
            in light of the concrete situation and the people involved.  He
            worried about the reduction of humans to their “functions,” and he
            worried about an increasing tendency to treat the central mysteries
            of human existence—namely love and death—as problems.
