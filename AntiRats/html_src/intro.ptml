        <p>
            Enlightenment rationalism may be said to have been birthed
            with the writings of Francis Bacon and Ren√© Descartes, and to have 
            come to self-awareness in the works of the French philosophes
            (e.g., Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet, and d'Alembert),
            and their allies, such as Benjamin Franklin, Immanuel Kant, and
            Thomas Paine. But almost contemporaneously with the birth of 
            this movement, it attracted critics.

            The aim of this project is to provide an overview of some of the
            most important of the many critics of Enlightenment rationalism.
            The essays on each thinker are intended not merely to offer a
            commentary on that thinker, but also to place him or her in the
            context of this larger stream of anti-rationalist thought.
            So, while this volume is not a history of anti-rationalist thought,
            it may contain the intimations of such a history.

            Some may wonder at the mixed bag of thinkers we address: poets,
            philosophers, economists, mathematicians, novelists, political
            theorists, urbanists, and philosophers. But there is unity in this
            diversity. Although these diverse authors worked in a variety of
            forms, they all sought to demonstrate the serious limitations in
            rationalism's description of the human situation. It is our 
            hope that surveying the variety of perspectives from which
            rationalism has been attacked will serve to clarify the
            difficulties the rationalist approach to understanding faces,
            rather than dispersing our critical attention. In other words, we 
            hope that these divergent streams flow together into a river,
            rather than meandering out to sea like the channels of a delta.

            The following as written doesn't really fit in the intro, but I
            think the ideas in it can find their place in the intro, so I leave
            it here for the moment:

            As I think I have shown in my work on Oakeshott, his
            political criticism of rationalism sprang directly from his
            philosophical view of the modes of experience: the rationalist in
            politics was guilty of an <i>ignoratio elenchi</i>. 
            And when Eliot writes of men "dreaming of systems so perfect that
            no one has to be good," he is expressing in poetry what Oakeshott
            expressed in verse.
