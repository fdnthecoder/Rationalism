            <p>
            This chapter analyzes Søren Kierkegaard’s attempt in <i>Two
                Ages</i> to refute the apparent rationality of political
            discourse in public media during the 1840s.  Kierkegaard identifies
            a separation between political speech and political action, because
            in the present age citizens lack the passion to match their words
            with deeds. Instead, Kierkegaard tries to unmask ulterior motives
            like envy and status competition that motivate apparently rational
            political discourse. The chapter aims to clarify the sense in which
            Kierkegaard is a critic of political rationalism, the limits of his
            critique, and its continuing relevance today.
