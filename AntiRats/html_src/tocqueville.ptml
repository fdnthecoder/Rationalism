            </h2>

            <p>
            In this chapter, we discuss Tocqueville’s nuanced criticism of
            rationalism by examining his views on the relationship between
            philosophy and politics in <i>Democracy in America</i> and
            <i>Recollections</i>. As a friend of democracy, Tocqueville teaches
            us that the preservation of liberty requires a new political
            science to educate the ineluctably emerging democratic social
            state. His political science finds that the ascendant political
            science of the enlightenment, which aims at wholesale social
            engineering, is actually an unscientific and partial ideology that
            is oblivious to certain aspects of the human condition and
            obliterates other parts.

            Tocqueville recognizes that both ethics and political science,
            culminating in legislation, require reasoned virtue. Thus, reason
            and political liberty are inherently complementary. Human happiness
            depends on the freedom to gain the experience by participating in
            politics in order to acquire good judgment and act successfully. On
            account of the very freedoms citizens must exercise, risk and
            uncertainty as well as disagreement and some disorder are
            inevitable. However, the kind of rationalism espoused by French
            philosophes, aiming to manufacture the conditions under which
            people may be rendered free and equal—especially equal—depends on
            assuming ever more control over people’s lives, destroying the
            politics properly so-called. As both a scholar and a statesman,
            Tocqueville witnessed firsthand multiple attempts to implement
            rationalistic systems firsthand following the end of the Old
            Regime. His more human science explains why theirs necessarily
            fails to produce the supposedly just society or free people they
            are purportedly designed to construct while succeeding instead at
            fostering ever more dehumanizing injustices.

            <p>
            Politics is not the highest thing and philosophy should not be
            wholly subservient to it, and people should not wholly submit to a
            rationalized politics that expects too much from politics and
            cannot appreciate what is beyond our outside of politics.
            Tocqueville’s political philosophy therefore recommends keeping
            some distance between politics and philosophy, for the sake of
            both, and ultimately for our sake. The relationship between
            politics and philosophy can best be described as an uneasy
            friendship. Reason and liberty should benefit each other mutually
            and reciprocally, but they cannot do so if they are in a
            relationship where one dominates the other in however well-meaning
            a fashion, or if it is imagined that their unity is too easily
            attained and secured. Political freedom requires virtue, and virtue
            requires reason, but reason is best developed when human beings are
            given the freedom to meet their greatest potential. Politics
            dominated by uncritical veneration of reason, especially an
            Enlightenment conception of reason that is simultaneously excessive
            and deficient, undermines virtue and freedom alike.
