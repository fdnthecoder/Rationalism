## Mimetic Desire and Mimetic Rivalry


## The Scapegoat as the "Solution" to Mimetic Rivalry


The scapegoat need not be innocent of all wrongdoing. In fact given the fallen

Trump’s own behavior contributed to the mimetic escalation in several ways. For
one thing, he was not adverse to scapegoating himself. For instance, well
