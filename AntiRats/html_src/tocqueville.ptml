            <p>
            This chapter discusses Alexis de Tocqueville’s nuanced criticism of
            rationalism. Being a modern liberal and critical friend of
            democracy, his political science finds that Enlightenment political
            science, which aims at wholesale social engineering, is actually an
            unscientific and partial ideology. Rationalism espoused by French
            philosophes and physiocrats depends on assuming ever more control
            over people’s lives, destroying politics properly so-called.
            Tocqueville recommends keeping some distance between politics and
            philosophy, for the sake of both, and ultimately for our sake. We
            discern that the relationship between politics and philosophy can
            best be described as an uneasy friendship. Reason and liberty
            should benefit each other mutually and reciprocally, but they
            cannot do so if they are in a relationship where one dominates the
            other in however well-meaning a fashion, or if it is imagined that
            their unity is too easily attained and secured. Political freedom
            requires virtue, and virtue requires reason, but reason is best
            developed when human beings are given the freedom to develop their
            own minds and character in association with others. Although reason
            and liberty are inherently complementary, politics dominated by an
            uncritical veneration of reason, especially an Enlightenment
            conception of reason that is simultaneously excessive and
            deficient, undermines virtue and freedom alike.
