        <p>
            Enlightenment rationalism may be said to have been birthed
            with the writings of Francis Bacon and Ren√© Descartes, and to have 
            come to self-awareness in the works of the French philosophes
            (e.g., Voltaire, Diderot, Condorcet, and d'Alembert),
            and their allies, such as Benjamin Franklin, Immanuel Kant, and
            Thomas Paine. But almost contemporaneously with the birth of 
            this movement, it attracted critics.

            The aim of this project is to provide an overview of some of the
            most important of the many critics of Enlightenment rationalism.
            The essays on each thinker are intended not merely to offer a
            commentary on that thinker, but also to place him or her in the
            context of this larger stream of anti-rationalist thought.
            So, while this volume is not a history of anti-rationalist thought,
            it may contain the intimations of such a history.
