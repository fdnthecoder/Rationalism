            Abstract
            </h2>
            
            <p>
            Alasdair MacIntyre (no relation) is best known for his critique of
            modern rationalist moral philosophy and his attempted resuscitation
            of the Aristotelian tradition of virtue ethics.  Of course, he is
            not alone in promoting a revitalization of Aristotle (and St.
            Thomas Aquinas), but he has offered the most well-known critique of
            the shallowness and ultimate vacuity of the two most prevalent
            forms of modern moral philosophy, utilitarianism and deontology.  I
            propose to offer a sympathetic account of his critique of modern
            moral rationalism, while also suggesting that his critique owes as
            much to other modern critics of moral rationalism, like Hegel and
            Collingwood, as it does to Aristotle and Aquinas.  I will also
            suggest that the primary weakness of MacIntyreâ€™s version of virtue
            ethics is that it does not adequately answer the challenges posed
            by modern moral pluralism to a unified conception of the human
            telos.  I will focus the essay, for the most part, on
            <i>After Virtue</i>,
            but will also address
            <i>A Short History of Ethics</i>,
            <i>Whose Justice?  Which Rationality?</i>,
            and <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry</i>.
