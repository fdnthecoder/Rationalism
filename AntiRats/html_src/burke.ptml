            Abstract
            </h2>

        <p>
            This chapter is going to present Edmund Burke, the 18th century
            statesman and political thinker, as the founder of a political
            tradition, which might with good reason be labelled as British
            conservatism. One of the key aspects of this -- in 1790 newly
            defined, but not at all new -- position is a serious doubt in the
            usefulness and applicability of a theoretically inclined reason in
            political affairs. Burke’s criticism of the French philosophes did
            not require much more argument than the practical destruction
            caused by their "social engineering", in the form of ever more
            radical (and more blood thirsty) revolutionary regimes. But he did
            not spare his intellectual energy and invention to show that the
            nature of politics is such that the sort of optimism so
            characteristic of the voluntary "creation ex nihilo" characteristic
            of enlightened intellectuals when they enter the political arena is
            not only logically unfounded, but also politically countproductive,
            or indeed pernicious.  This chapter will focus on those parts of
            Burke’s <i>Reflections</i> (1790) which helped to identify a less
            optimistic, but more realistic view of politics, which has
            characteristic British traits: a belief in the rational values of
            such non-instrumentally-rational political institutions as
            precedents,  custom and political experience, which will later
            serve as the foundation of the political philosophy of British
            conservatism.
