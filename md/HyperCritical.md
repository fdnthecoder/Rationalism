# HyperCritical Race Theory

Gene Callahan

"we‘re sick and tired of your ism schism game￼"

"Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for that gold ring
Down inside
Never could reach it
Just slips away
When I try"
￼￼
Man sits on a moving swing, rising at one moment so high that he feels he can
nearly touch heaven, dipping so low at the next that he Is singed by the flames
of hell. ￼ This is what Plato referred to as the metaxy, the "in-between" of
human existence. How great is the temptation, at the top of the arc, to try to
seize hold of that paradise so near.￼￼

Truth is only intrasystemic... first you must accept the premises, then discuss
its content — V. Pg 236 Drama

If you do not accept the premises of critical race theory, that cannot be
discussed: you are simply branded a racist, and dismissed￼

" to believe on insufficient evidence is a decision, it’s an immoral act to
believe with insufficient evidence￼." V. 237

" once this Mode of being￼ has been realized, it is as difficult to get out of
it as it is to wake oneself up￼" V. quoting Sartre 238

￼
Whether Race has any biological reality is irrelevant to ethical and political
questions, where the relevant question is "does it have any moral meaning?" but
while dismissing Race as a biological characteristic, it is the critical race
theory us who answer the latter question with a resounding "yes," in all of
their condemnation of "whiteness."￼￼

"Replacing the first reality of experience by the second reality of imaginative
construction, and endowing￼ the imaginary reality with the appearance of truth
by letting it absorb pieces of first reality"￼

Voegelin, on Hegel, page 224￼

"The fanaticism of smashing all establish social order, of removing all
individual suspect of harboring order in their existence, and of annihilating
every attempt at re-organization. Only by destroying something has this
negative well the feeling of its own existence. Even if he believes to Willa
positive state, as friends since the state of general quality... It does in fact
not want its realization for that would reestablish the very order... From whose
annihilation this negative freedom drives it self-consciousness" — Voegelin
quoting Hegel, p. 158 vol. 12

Ideologies gain their plausibility because they have genuinely pointed at
something that is really a sin, say "racism" or "capitalist exploitation." The
problem with them is that they try to treat that one sin as though it were the
only sin in existence.


How to differentiate a religious leader from a cult leader: a religious leader
tries to point followers to a greater reality which he admits he only partially
comprehends. A cult leader tries to entrap followers in an epistemic closure in
which he knows everything.


"Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small... the purpose is not
to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the
less it corresponds to reality the better."
— Theodore Dalrymple

The charge of "whataboutism" is *not* a way of replying to a critic. It is a way of *ignoring* the critic. Look:

MARXIST: The capitalists exploited the workers.

CRITIC: OK, but what about the fact that the USSR threw millions of workers into Gulags?

MARXIST: Ah! Whataboutism!!!
