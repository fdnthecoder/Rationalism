            Anti-rationalism, Relativism, and the Metaphysical Tradition:
            Situating Gadamer’s Philosophical Hermeneutics 
        </h1>

        <p>
            Hans-Georg Gadamer repeatedly acknowledges his deep indebtedness to
            Martin Heidegger.  His habilitation dissertation was done under
            Heidegger, and Heidegger’s historicism had a deep and lasting
            impact on Gadamer’s theory of philosophical hermeneutics.  This
            influence has led many to conclude – with positive attribution, in
            those such as Richard Rorty, or with negative attribution, in those
            such as Leo Strauss – that Gadamer is a moral relativist.  Yet,
            notwithstanding his explicit appropriation of Heidegger, Gadamer
            refutes this charge throughout his career.  What is even more
            perplexing is that Gadamer’s relationship to the metaphysical
            tradition runs deep.  Indeed, one prominent commentator has
            described him as having roots in a metaphysical tradition that
            encompasses Plato, Neoplatonism, and St. Augustine.  What is more,
            Gadamer explicitly and somewhat bluntly refers to himself late in
            his career as a “Platonist.”  This essay will seek to explore
            Gadamer’s ambivalent relationship to Heidegger and the unusual way
            in which he combines Heidegger’s historicism, which itself has
            radically relativistic implications, with the tradition of Western
            metaphysics that was the very target of Heidegger’s critique.
