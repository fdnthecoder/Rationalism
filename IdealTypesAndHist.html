ABSTRACT
</h3>


<p>
A number of social theorists have contended that
the essence of historical analysis is the employment of ideal types
to comprehend past goings-on. But, while acknowledging that the
study of history through ideal types can yield genuine insight, we
may still ask if it represents the full emancipation of historical
understanding from other modes of conceiving the past. This paper
follows Michael Oakeshott’s work on the philosophy of history in
arguing that explaining the historical past by means of ideal
types, even though offering a coherent and fruitful enterprise,
nevertheless falls short of fully embodying the characteristics
that differentiate historical understanding.
</p>


<p>
This dispute involves fundamental issues
regarding the nature of the social sciences. Furthermore, I suggest
that it is of more than purely theoretical interest, in that social
theorists who have accepted the Weberian view of historical inquiry
will tend to be unaware of the defects inherent in all attempts to
capture the nature of past events in a net of generalizations, and
thus may be lead to ignore the inherent partiality of the
understanding of historical happenings provided by ideal
typification.

<h3>
Introduction
</h3>


<p>
A number of significant social scientists,
including Wilhelm Dilthey, Max Weber, Ludwig von Mises, Alfred
Schutz, and Fritz Machlup, have contended that the essence of
historical analysis is the employment of theoretically constructed
ideal types to comprehend past goings-on. But, while acknowledging
that the study of history through the lens of ideal types can yield
genuine insight, we may still ask if it represents the full
emancipation of historical understanding from other modes of
conceiving the human past, or whether there is, perhaps, an
approach that must be regarded as its superior at exemplifying the
unique character of history. In this paper I contend that Michael
Oakeshott’s work on the philosophy of history convincingly argues
that explaining the historical past by means of ideal types, even
though offering a coherent and fruitful enterprise, nevertheless
falls short of fully embodying the characteristics that
differentiate history from other modes of knowledge.
</p>


<p>
This dispute is worth our attention because it
involves fundamental issues regarding the nature of the social
sciences. Furthermore, I suggest that it is of more than purely
theoretical interest, in that social theorists who have accepted
the Weberian view of historical inquiry will tend to be unaware of
the defects inherent in all attempts to capture the complex and
individual nature of past events in an abstract net of
generalizations, and thus may be led to ignore the inherent
partiality of the understanding of historical happenings provided
by ideal typification.

<h3>
Ideal Types as the Method of History
</h3>


<p>
Weber’s conception of the character of historical
research is neatly summarized (and also endorsed) by Mises, who
writes, “the difference between sociology and history is considered
as only one of degree. In both, the object of cognition is
identical. Both make use of the same logical method [i.e., ideal
types] of forming concepts. They are different merely in the extent
of their proximity to reality, their fullness of content, and the
purity of their ideal-typical constructions” (Mises, 2002, <a href=
"http://www.mises.org/epofe/c2sec3.asp">http://www.mises.org/epofe/c2sec3.asp</a>).
</p>


<p>
One of Weber’s most explicit statements of this
view appears in his essay, “The Logic of the Cultural Sciences,”
where he says: “Even the first steep toward an historical judgment
is thus—this is to be emphasized—a process of <i>abstraction</i>….
Even this first step transforms the given ‘reality’ into a “mental
construct” [i.e., an ideal type] in order to make it into
historical fact” (1949, p. 173).
</p>


<p>
Schutz, an admirer of Weber and one of the
foremost theorists of the ideal-type method, held that such
abstractions are not found only in the constructs built by the
social scientist, but also are constitutive of the everyday social
world (as did Weber: see (Weber, 1949: 177-180). Except for the
case of the "pure" Thou-orientation that occurs in face-to-face
encounters, <i>all</i> of our relationships with and understandings
of other people are mediated by the use of ideal types of varying
degrees of anonymity. (The concept that one way of classifying
ideal types is according to how anonymous they are can be made
clear with a simple example: we might, in order of decreasing
anonymity, regard some individual as an instance of the ideal type
"Englishman," "early-twentieth-century Englishman,"
"early-twentieth-century Londoner," "early-twentieth-century,
working-class Londoner," and " early-twentieth-century London
chimney sweep.") Since the historian, qua historian, is
<i>never</i> in a Thou-relationship with the historical actors
whose deeds he seeks to comprehend, Schutz's view implies that he
<i>must</i> employ one or more ideal types in his undertaking. (See
Schutz, [1932] 1967, especially pp. 176-250.) Roger Koppl contends
that, for Schutz, what differentiates history from a more
theoretical social science such as sociology is only the degree of
anonymity of the ideal types it employs: "What we call either
'history' or 'applied economics' entails the use of relatively
concrete ideal types.&nbsp;'Theory' uses more anonymous types"
(1998 COMPLETE).
</p>


<p>
Forwarding a similar view, Mises writes:
"Although unique and unrepeatable, historical events have one
common feature: they are human action…. What counts for history is
always the meaning of the men concerned: the meaning that they
attach to the state of affairs they want to alter, the meaning they
attach to their actions, and the meaning they attach to the effects
produced by the actions" (Mises, 1966: 59).
</p>


<p>
Since the subject matter of history is composed
of these human meanings, Mises argues that the historian cannot
avoid employing some conceptual framework that enables him to
abstract categories of meaning from the myriad of specific meanings
that have composed the circumstances and actions of historical
individuals: "The aspect from which history arranges and assorts
the infinite multiplicity of events is their meaning. The
<i>only</i> principle which it applies for the systemization of its
objects­--men, ideas, institutions, social entities, and
artifacts­-- is meaning affinity. According to meaning affinity it
arranges the elements into ideal types… Ideal types are specific
notions employed in historical research and in the representation
of its results" (Mises, 1966: 59).
</p>


<p>
Finally, here is Machlup in the same vein:
“Analysis of human action with aid of constructs isolating,
idealizing, and exaggerating some human trait or function is needed
both for historical and theoretical investigation. That is to say,
the ‘breaking up’ of ‘whole man’ is needed for understanding the
actions of <i>historical</i> persons…” (Machlup, 1978: 268).
</p>


<p>
Having presented above a brief, but hopefully
sufficient, summary of the ideal-type theory of history, I want to
differentiate a trivial sense in which the proposition that
historians necessarily employ such types is obviously true from a
stronger thesis that I understand the afore-mentioned thinkers to
be presenting. Historians always use human languages to convey
their findings, and, as such, they must continually employ words
that denote general classes of objects, events, or activities.
Those words, in the Weber-Schutz view of ideal types, might
sensibly be regarded as referencing very fundamental ideal types.
No practical language can do without such generalized denotators.
Any “language” in which each signifier stood for only one, specific
object or event in the world would be next-to-useless for
communication, as there would be no way, short of a speaker
bringing his audience into the immediate presence of the aspect of
reality he had “named” and then pointing at it, by which his
audience could hope to grasp his intended meaning (See O’Neill,
1996: 40, and Joseph, 2002:19).
</p>


<p>
The very nature of human language makes it
impossible for the historian to compose a sensible narrative about
the past that is not replete with generic terms. If an historian
writes, “A messenger ran from Marathon to Athens to carry news of
the Athenian victory to the city,” she is employing general
concepts like “messenger,” “running,” “news,” and “victory.”
</p>


<p>
However, our “ideal-type historians” clearly are
making a less trivial contention. An historian who undertakes an
analysis of the High Middle Ages using concepts like “the nature of
serfdom,” “the role of the peasantry,” “monasticism,” “feudal
obligations,” and “the rise of the town,” is invoking a level of
abstraction going far beyond that needed merely to speak
intelligibly. The question at hand is whether constructing such
higher-level ideal types is the essential method of historical
understanding.
</p>

<p class="h3"><b>An Alternative View of Historical
Understanding</b>
</p>


<p>
So is the analysis of past events in terms of
their conformity to various ideal types the ultimate method of
history? Michael Oakeshott, who, among his varied intellectual
achievements, is regarded as one of the more important philosophers
of history of the twentieth century, rejected that view. He did not
dismiss the effort to understand the past with the aid of ideal
types as incoherent or fruitless, but argued that it could not
achieve a fully historical account of the situations it sought to
explain. Furthermore, he suggested that a method for achieving such
an account <i>does</i> exist.
</p>


<p>
While I find the argument Oakeshott offers
against regarding ideal typification as the fundamental tool of
historiography to be convincing as it stands, I believe it is
worthwhile to review his case here for three reasons:
</p>


<p>
1) Oakeshott presents his argument in a dense
and, at least to those unversed in it, rather obscure prose style.
As Paul Franco, author of a recent introduction to Oakeshott's
thought, puts it, "Reading the late Oakeshott, like reading the
late Henry James, can be a vertiginous experience" (2004, p. 142).
I suspect that a satisfactory understanding of some of his points
requires of the reader a more than passing familiarity with much of
his later work. So it seems to me that an exegesis of his case,
employing a less individualized vocabulary, could be of use to
anyone who is interested in historical methodology but is not
prepared to undertake an extensive study of Oakeshott's mature
thought.
</p>


<p>
2) While it is clear to me that Oakeshott is
addressing ideal-type methodology in the passages I cite below, he
neither explicitly says so, nor does he cite the theorists of
history whose methodology he is critiquing. (The paucity of
references throughout Oakeshott's works is a general problem
plaguing any scholar attempting to locate their place in the
broader intellectual currents of his time.) As a result, a search
of the literature on ideal types is not likely to even turn up
Oakeshott's analysis. I hope that an exposition of Oakeshott's
argument that is more transparent in regards to what theory of
history is being examined will aid others doing research in the
area.
</p>


<p>
3) Although, as I mentioned above, I consider
Oakeshott's critique of ideal-type history to be adequate to his
purpose, it is a rather terse consideration of that methodology,
appearing in a book addressing many other facets of historical
understanding. Therefore, an expanded version of it, particularly
one that fleshes out the bare bones presented by Oakeshott with
some concrete examples, may serve to make his argument more
accessible.
</p>


<p>
The case I present here has been anticipated, to
a degree, and in a specifically Austrian context, in Kaplan (1987).
However, while the focus of Kaplan’s analysis of the ideal-type
method is on demonstrating that it is incapable of arriving at
general sociological laws, this paper asserts that it does not even
represent a full realization of the unique character of historical
inquiry.
</p>


<p>
So, let us examine Oakeshott’s thesis in some
detail. He launches his consideration of whether ideal typification
is the primary method of history by acknowledging that it <i>is</i>
an historical method: "A past composed of carefully anatomized
situations of various magnitudes, durations and constitutions,
themselves composed of mutually and conceptually related
occurrences, is certainly a past which has been endowed with a
certain level of historical intelligibility…. [It] cannot be denied
the character of an historical enquiry" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65).
</p>


<p>
The term "ideal type" does not appear in the
passage just quoted -- indeed, as I mentioned above, Oakeshott
never uses it anywhere in the argument under consideration here.
Therefore, it may seem unclear that he even is referring to ideal
types. However, he goes on to offer some examples of the approach
he is contemplating that, I suggest, demonstrate that he is doing
just that. The type of historical inquiry he is considering is
exhibited, he declares, by "an historian… who spells out the
character of Elizabethan Puritanism or of a doctrine identified as
'civic humanism,' who unfolds 'the structure of English politics on
the accession of George III,' or who (like Fernand Braudel)
specifies the 'energy resources' of Europe in the late eighteenth
century…" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65-66). Those are all clearly
examples of historical ideal types <i>a la</i> Weber.
</p>


<p>
While, as noted above, Oakeshott acknowledges
that this approach to the past is genuinely historical—unlike, for
example, the legendary past or the didactic past, which is mined as
a source of stories providing guidance to those facing practical
choices in the present—he contends that, nevertheless, it suffers
from only partially realizing the ideal character of distinctively
historical inquiry: "But although it has been called the most
sophisticated understanding of the past, it is, I think, an
unstable level of historical understanding. It recognizes (or
half-recognizes) what it cannot itself accommodate, and it cannot
defend itself against being superseded by what is a genuine
competitor, critical of it in its own terms, and thus capable of
superseding it" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65).
</p>


<p>
Oakeshott holds "an historical past may be
regarded as a passage of historical change" (Oakeshott, 1999: 121).
But in any explanation of past events as instances of ideal types
the consideration of change can play at best a supporting role.
Because an ideal type is constructed by abstracting out patterns
seen as common to a number of concrete historical situations, it
focuses the theorist's attention on an unchanging constellation of
properties present in each episode, and directs it away from the
unique and contingent events that led to each exemplar, and also
away from the particular and ever-shifting characteristics by which
each instance of the type differs from the idealization. The
historian engaged in ideal type analysis "purports to be
anatomizing a bygone present situational identity in terms of its
constituent occurrences. No doubt he recognizes himself to be
concerned with a passage of time which contains genuine change; but
his enquiry, centred upon the articulation of a situational
identity, cannot properly accommodate this recognition" (1999, p.
65).
</p>


<p>
Furthermore, the very nature of an ideal type as
a static constellation of intelligibly related patterns of social
life renders it ill-suited for discovering the specific historical
events that explain the appearance of each unique instance of the
type at a particular time and in a particular place: "And further,
an engagement to anatomize an historical situation, in specifying
its duration, recognizes it as an emergence and admits its
evanescence; but the enquiry is not concerned to abate the mystery
of its appearance upon the scene, to investigate the mediation of
its appearance or to trace the vicissitudes of its evanescence. It
is concerned only with correctly inferring an intelligible
structure composed of notionally contemporaneous mutually related
constituent occurrences" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65-66).
</p>


<p>
Oakeshott sums up his critique as follows:
"These, then, are what I take to be the historical defects of an
enquiry concerned to infer from record a past composed of
situational identities: transitory passages of human engagement
represented as patterned situations composed of mutually related
occurrences which come and go but are here halted and made to
gyrate in a notional interval between coming and going"
(Oakeshott, 1999: 66). He goes on to suggest the solution to the
difficulties he has pointed out: "And the remedy for the
shortcomings of this level of historical understanding is not, I
think, in doubt. It lies in an enquiry designed to assemble a past,
not of anatomized situational identities composed of mutually
related occurrences, but of historical events and conjunctions of
historical events" (Oakeshott, 1999: 67-68).
</p>


<p>
The critique of ideal type history presented
above bears some non-superficial similarity to Onora O’Neill’s
distinction between <i>abstraction</i> and <i>idealization</i>. For
O’Neill:
</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Abstraction, taken straightforwardly, is a
matter of <i>bracketing</i>, but not of <i>denying</i>, predicates
that are true of the matter under discussion. Abstraction <i>in
this strict sense</i> is theoretically and practically unavoidable…
Idealization is another matter: it can easily lead to falsehood. An
assumption, and derivatively a theory, idealizes when it ascribes
predicates—often seen as enhanced, ‘ideal’ predicates—that are
false of the case in hand…” (O’Neill: 1996: 39-44)
</p>


<p>
However, the analogy is only partial. While the
theoreticians of history certainly will use idealizations in
O’Neill’s sense—see, for instance, the quote from Machlup above—I
believe that Oakeshott’s critique also applies to the use of
abstractions beyond the level that would be required for an
ordinary, natural language description of events.
</p>


<h3>
An Illustrative Case
</h3>


<p>
Thomas Kuhn, <i>In The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions</i>, describes the history of science as it typically
had been practiced up to the time of his writing (Kuhn, 1962) as an
attempt to comb the past for evidence of what has been termed “the
Whig view” of scientific progress, wherein science makes slow,
steady progress from ignorance and error toward knowledge and
truth:
</p>


<p>
“If science is the constellation of facts,
theories, and methods collected in current texts, then…
[s]cientific development becomes the piecemeal process by which
these items have been added, singly or in combination, to the ever
growing stockpile that constitutes scientific technique and
knowledge. And history of science becomes the discipline that
chronicles both these successive increments and the obstacles that
have inhibited their accumulation. Concerned with scientific
development, the historian then appears to have two main tasks. On
the one hand, he must determine by what man and at what point in
time each contemporary scientific fact, law, and theory was
discovered or invented. On the other, he must describe and explain
the congeries of error, myth, and superstition that have inhibited
the more rapid accumulation of the constituents of the modern
science text.” (Kuhn, 1962: 1-2)
</p>


<p>
What Kuhn is describing is a view of history
based on the ideal type, “the steady progress of scientific
knowledge.” (I have no evidence that Kuhn ever heard of the notion
of “ideal types,” but that is irrelevant as to whether that is what
he is -- perhaps unwittingly -- discussing. As I will attempt to
demonstrate, he employs them despite his apparent unfamiliarity
with the concept.) But Kuhn does not recommend replacing the
history of science he criticizes with one arrived at via
Oakeshott’s method of examining the concrete series of differences
through which historical research might render more intelligible
some sequence of events. Instead, he reconstructs the history of
science through the lens of a small number of other ideal types:
“paradigms,” “pre-paradigmatic science,” “normal science,” “novel
discoveries,” and “paradigm shifts.”
</p>


<p>
That Kuhn’s notion of a paradigm falls with the
category of ideal types can be seen by examining the examples of
paradigms he lists: “’Ptolemaic astronomy’ (or ‘Copernican’),
‘Aristotelian dynamics’ (or ‘Newtonian’), ‘corpuscular optics’ (or
‘wave optics’), and so on” (Kuhn, 1962: 10). Such examples clearly
parallel Oakeshott’s “the character of Elizabethan Puritanism,”
“civic humanism,” or “the structure of English politics on the
accession of George III” (cited above). And we can find the same
sort of categories in, for example, Mises:
</p>


<p>
“No historical problem can be treated without the
aid of ideal types. Even when the historian deals with an
individual person or with a single event, he cannot avoid referring
to ideal types. If he speaks of Napoleon, he must refer to such
ideal types as commander, dictator, revolutionary leader; and if he
deals with the French Revolution he must refer to ideal types such
as revolution, disintegration of an established regime, anarchy”
(1966, p. 60).
</p>


<p>
Kuhn recognizes that an ideal type must be
abstracted from an historical situation: “Why is the concrete
scientific achievement, as a locus of professional commitment,
prior to the various laws, theories, and points of view that may be
abstracted from it?” (Kuhn, 1962: 11). His adherence to the ideal
type approach is further displayed in passages such as: “Examining
selected discoveries in the rest of this section, we shall quickly
find that they are not isolated events but extended episodes with a
regularly recurrent structure” (Kuhn, 1962: 52, emphasis mine).
</p>


<p>
Kuhn sees that he must carefully reconstruct the
historical evidence in order to fit it into his ideal types: “In a
third area, however, the existence of significant parallels between
the discoveries of oxygen and of X-rays is far less apparent”
(Kuhn, 1962: 58). He even acknowledges that his ideal-type
reconstruction will necessarily be incomplete: “Breakdown of the
normal technical puzzle-solving activity is not, of course, the
only ingredient of the astronomical crisis that faced Copernicus.
An extended treatment would also discuss the social pressure for
calendar reform… medieval criticism of Aristotle, the rise of
Renaissance Neoplatonism…” However, while he sees the inadequacy of
his method, he can only conceive of amending it by incorporating
more ideal types – “the social pressure for calendar reform,”
“medieval criticism of Aristotle,” and “Renaissance Neoplatonism” –
into a more complete account.
</p>


<p>
Imre Lakatos notes this shortcoming in Kuhn’s
“rational reconstruction” of the history of science. (By rational
reconstruction, Lakatos clearly means the interpretation of history
according to particular ideal types of how science adavances.) For
example, he complains, “let us imagine that in spite of the
objectively progressing astronomical research programmes,
astronomers are suddenly gripped by a feeling of Kuhnian ‘crisis’;
and they are all converted… to astrology…. All [the Kuhnian] sees
is a’crisis’ followed by a mass conversion effect in the scientific
community: an ordinary revolution. Nothing is left problematic and
unexplained” (Lakatos, 1978: 135-136).
</p>


<p>
However, Lakatos himself is unable to conceive of
an historical method superior to ideal type analysis, and so he can
only suggest replacing Kuhn’s preferred ideal types with his own,
the “progressive research programme.” Indeed, echoing Mises,
Lakatos declares “<i>History without some theoretical ‘bias’ is
impossible</i>” (Lakatos, 1978: 120, emphasis in original). But
Lakatos offers no more justification for that claim than that he
can detect a theoretical bias even in histories where they are
“obscured by an eclectic variation of theories or by theoretical
confusion” (Lakatos, 1978: 120). However, the fact that the
histories Lakatos has examined all <i>do</i> show some theoretical
bias is nothing like a demonstration that all history <i>must</i>
do so. Even if he could show the impossibility of any real
historian operating without such a bias – which he does not even
attempt to do -- he still would not have demonstrated that ideal
history would not be free of such bias, and that, as a corollary,
actual history should try to eliminate it. (Analogously, a survey
revealing that all works of history examined contain factual errors
certainly would not indicate that making mistakes about facts is an
intrinsic aspect of the historian’s research.)
</p>


<p>
Contrary to the claim Lakatos makes, there exist
many works on the history of science that, while not pristinely
exemplifying Oakeshott’s superior style of historical inquiry,
nevertheless consist primarily of efforts to understand episodes
from the past in terms of the specific conditions from which they
arose. To cite just one example, Richard Westfall’s biography of
Isaac Newton, <i>Never at Rest</i>, does not explain Newton’s
achievements by invoking a Kuhnian scientific revolutionary or a
Lakatosian founder of a research program, but as the results of
Newton’s particular abilities and circumstances. I offer just one
typical, but I think sufficient, example as an illustration:
</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Newtown’s early notes on analysis
investigated the relation of particular axes to the equation of a
curve. He tried various transformations of axes in order to
simplify equations, seeking a regularized procedure whereby one of
the new axes would also be an axis of the curve. He was
not yet beyond fairly simply mistakes. Like the early analysts, he
did not at first comprehend the significance of negative roots. He
drew the cubic parabola, x<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>y, as though
it were it were symmetrical with respect to the y axis, and
somewhat later he can find his diagram of Descartes’s folium, the
curve x<sup>3</sup> – axy + y<sup>3</sup> = 0, to the first
quadrant, tacitly assuming that its shape is identical in all four
quadrants. He learned quickly, however. By October, he comprehended
negative roots clearly enough to set down the rule that when the x
axis is the diameter of a curve such that it bisects all the
ordinates, then y cannot appear in the equation in odd powers
because there is a negative root of equal absolute value
corresponding to every positive one. Above all, he seized and made
his own the central insight of analytic geometry. Already in
September he proposed a problem to himself in the following terms:
‘Haveing y<sup>e</sup> nature of a crooked line expressed in
Algebr: termes to find its axes, to determin it &amp; describe it
geometrically &amp;c.’” (Westfall, 1980: 107)
</p>


<p>
As noted above, no historical analysis presented
in a natural human language can avoid the use of absract terms, and
the passage from Westfall cited above is no exception.
Nevertheless, I contend that the difference in the level of
abstraction displayed by the work of Kuhn and Lakatos, on the one
hand, and Westfall, on the other, amounts to a difference in kind
and not merely degree. Westfall does not seek to explain Newton’s
advances in terms of highly generic concepts like “the
revolutionary scientist,” “the paradigm shift,” or “a progressive
research programme.” Instead, Newton’s progress is made more
intelligible by examining the specific mathematical topics he
addressed and the particular approaches that enabled him to achieve
breakthroughs in those areas.
</p>


<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>


<p>
Ideal-type analysis yields, by its very nature,
an understanding of an event in terms of its similarity to other
events. It may very well succeed in rendering the past more
intelligible. But, for Oakeshott and this author, it fails to
produce a fully historical past. That can only arise from a
contemplation of the past as a passage of differences whose
continuity makes a subsequent event explicable. In his view, it is
the unique task of history to comprehend the past not in terms of
whatever regularities it may exhibit, what typical situations may
be abstracted from it, or any general precepts it is held to
illustrate, but as an assemblage of events each of which is unique
and unrepeatable. Such a view does not disparage other approaches
to understanding the past; it only proposes that they "do not mix
with and cannot take the place of an historical understanding
concerned with what was actually the case, there and then, in terms
of situations composed entirely of mutually related occurrences
inferred from the record" (Oakeshott, 1999: 65).
