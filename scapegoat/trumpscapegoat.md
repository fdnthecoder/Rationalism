# The Scapegoat

The "mimetic" theory of Rene Girard, I suggest, offers us our best way to
understand the extraordinary events of recent American politics.

## Mimetic Desire and Mimetic Rivalry


## The Scapegoat as the "Solution" to Mimetic Rivalry


The scapegoat need not be innocent of all wrongdoing. In fact given the fallen
nature of the world, there was only ever a single scapegoat who was innocent of
all wrongdoing. It is not innocence that characterizes the scapegoat, but the
fact that he is held to be guilty of causing all the problems of the community
exorcising him.

## External Mediation vs. Internal Mediation


## "Degree" as the Means of Blocking the Violence of Internal Mediation

One of the key features of the Trump presidency was the erosion of "degree" due
to Trump's constant tweeting, and his continual refusal to "act presidential."

The new capitol fencing as an attempt to re-establish degree.


## The Crisis of Degree

Troilus and Cressida:

O, when degree is shaked,  
Which is the ladder to all high designs,  
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,  
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,  
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,  
The primogenitive and due of birth,  
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,  
But by degree, stand in authentic place?  
Take but degree away, untune that string,  
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets  
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters  
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores  
And make a sop of all this solid globe:  
Strength should be lord of imbecility,  
And the rude son should strike his father dead:  
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,  
Between whose endless jar justice resides,  
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.  
Then every thing includes itself in power,  
Power into will, will into appetite;  
And appetite, an universal wolf,  
So doubly seconded with will and power,  
Must make perforce an universal prey,  
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,  
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,  
Follows the choking.  
And this neglection of degree it is  
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose  
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd  
By him one step below, he by the next,  
That next by him beneath; so every step,  
Exampled by the first pace that is sick  
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever  
Of pale and bloodless emulation:  


Egalitarians are absolutely correct in noting that most differences of degree
(social status) 
are arbitrary and not perfectly just.

But they are wrong in contending that, therefore, they can be abolished. In the
City of Man, rife with mimetic rivalry, differences of degree, however
arbitrary they may be, are necessary in order to prevent external mimetic
rivalry from turning into violent, internal medic rivalry. It is only in the
City of God, where mimetic rivalry has been set aside, that differences of
degree can actually be abolished. In the City of Man, purportedly egalitarian
schemes, in fact, only result in replacement of one elite buy another one. The
destruction of the Russian elite of nobility and church hierarchy by the
Bolsheviks did not, in fact, create an egalitarian society: it only created a
new, bolshevik elite.

“it takes less and less time for more and more people to polarize against more
and more victims for flimsier and flimsier reasons...

“The contagion is such that the entire community is finally divided into two
vast ‘conspiracies’ they can only do one thing: go to war with each other.” —
Sh. 195


Trump’s own behavior contributed to the mimetic escalation in several ways. For
one thing, he was not adverse to scapegoating himself. For instance, well
illegal immigration is certainly a problem America has to address, Trump
sometimes seem to imply that illegal immigrants were about the only problem
America had to address.

“Such a crisis can only be regarded as the responsibility of all citizens… In
no case can this crisis be the responsibility of a single individual, however
powerful he happens to be.” Sh 207
