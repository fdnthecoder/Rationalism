            <p>
            Russell Kirk was one of the intellectual founders of the American
            conservative movement in the mid-twentieth century, and his legacy
            echoes even among those who do not know his name.
            </p>
            <p>
            Kirk reminded us of the limitations of human rationality.  He
            opposed schemes for collectivizing property and centralizing power,
            for such rationalist plans failed to account for the limits of
            human knowledge and goodness.  When implemented, they brought
            misery to millions.  Against the rationalist confidence of the
            central planners, Kirk set tradition, which he saw as a repository
            of human experience and the tried and true wisdom of the past.
            </p>
            <p>
            Beginning with his most famous work, The Conservative Mind, Kirk
            brought Edmund Burke into his proper place in the conservative
            pantheon.  Burke’s reverence for tradition and abhorrence of
            radical revolution make him an obvious inspiration for conservative
            intellectuals.  Kirk also offered unique insight into Burke’s blend
            of natural law thinking and historical consciousness, which offers
            valuable insights for conservative political theory.  There are
            real moral obligations upon us, but the mystery of human existence
            prevents us from delineating once and for all a perfect system of
            moral philosophy, or an ideal political system.

            And Kirk knew that man lives not by bread alone, but on
            imagination.  Thus, he wrote not only academic works, but columns,
            popular books such as The American Cause, and even short stories.
            Truth, whether moral, cultural or political, is apprehended as much
            by the imagination as by reason.  Throughout them he used his
            talents to leaven the conservative revival with humility and
            reverence.
