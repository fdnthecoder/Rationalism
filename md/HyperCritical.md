# HyperCritical Race Theory

Gene Callahan


The charge of "whataboutism" is *not* a way of replying to a critic. It is a way of *ignoring* the critic. Look:

MARXIST: The capitalists exploited the workers.

CRITIC: OK, but what about the fact that the USSR threw millions of workers into Gulags?

MARXIST: Ah! Whataboutism!!!
