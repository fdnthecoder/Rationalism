# The Scapegoat

The "mimetic" theory of Rene Girard, I suggest, offers us our best way to
understand the extraordinary events of recent American politics. In order to
see why, it will be useful to present a brief glossary of some Girardian terms.

## Mimetic Desire and Mimetic Rivalry

Girard demonstrated that most human desire is not innate or self-chosen, but
results from imitating what others desire. Girard called this "mimetic desire."
(Of course, this all had to arise from more basic desires, such as for food and
sex, that were not mimetic.) Mimetic desire places human beings in fundamental
conflict with each other: if my desire for that house on the hill is an
emulation of your desire for that same house... well, we both can't own it, can
we? Girard notes that this is why the Ten Commandments place such an emphasis
on "not coveting your neighbor's X": that coveting is the basis of all social
conflict. Adam and Eve covet God's knowledge of good and evil, and we have the
Fall. Cain covets God's approval of Abel, and we have the first
fratricide.

## The Scapegoat as the "Solution" to Mimetic Rivalry

When mimetic rivalry threatens to tear a society apart, there is a solution,
short of abandoning rivalrous mimetic desire: the society can identify a
scapegoat, a figure upon whom all of the chaos swirling through the social
order can be blamed, and can sacrifice that scapegoat, restoring order (for a
time). The sacrifice can be a literal killing (as with Socrates, or Jesus), or
it can be merely the destruction of the scapegoat's life, as in contemporary
"cancel culture." The rest of the society, having united in the destruction of
the scapegoat, experiences a great catharsis, and social peace is temporarily
restored. Girard offers the "miracle of Apollonius" as a paradigmatic example
of this process: a plague (both physical and social) has descended upon the
city of Ephesus, and they ask the Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius for
aid. Apollonius points out a beggar, dressed in rags, to the people of the
city, and directs them to stone him, as he is actually a demon in disguise. The
people are at first reluctant, but once one of them "casts the first stone,"
they are overcome with "mimetic contagion" and
enthusiastically stone the beggar, after which the city recovers from its
plague.

The scapegoat need not be innocent of all wrongdoing. In fact given the fallen
nature of the world, there was only ever a single scapegoat who was innocent of
all wrongdoing. It is not innocence that characterizes the scapegoat, but the
fact that he is held to be guilty of causing *all* the problems of the community
exorcising him. And modern history offers plenty of examples of such
scapegoating: Hitler scapegoating the Jews, Pol Pot the intellectuals, or Mao 
the traditionalists.

## External Mediation vs. Internal Mediation

Another important Girardian concept we ought to understand is the difference
between "external mediation" and "internal mediation." The figure whom we
imitate to mold our desires (the mediator of our desires)
can appear more or less remote from us. If, for
instance, we live in an aristocratic society, and are members of the
bourgeoisie, we might adopt our modes of dress, our ideas of "fine cuisine," of
"high art," and grand housing from the nobility: but, in general, we can't hope
to *become* a noble: in that case, Girard calls the nobility "external
mediators" for the bourgeoisie. A similar case might be the attitude of the
average American male in the 1950s towards John Wayne or Cary Grant: he might
choose one of these figures as his model, but he never seriously imagined he
was *in competition* with Wayne or Grant: for instance, he might try to dress
or act like Wayne or Grant, but he would never imagine that he could seduce
their wives or own one of their houses.

Mediation becomes "internal" when the "mediator," the source of one's desires,
is not seen as separated from oneself by any unbridgeable gulf. So, as in the
many mythical and historical examples of rival brothers, what one brother has
the other brother can easily conceive of himself as having: and so Jacob tricks
his father into granting him Esau's birthright, or, in the multitude of royal
murders throughout history, a close heir to a throne murders a closer heir to
that throne in order to grab it for him-or-her-self.

## "Degree" as the Means of Blocking the Violence of Internal Mediation



## The Crisis of Degree

Troilus and Cressida:

O, when degree is shaked,  
Which is the ladder to all high designs,  
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,  
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,  
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,  
The primogenitive and due of birth,  
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,  
But by degree, stand in authentic place?  
Take but degree away, untune that string,  
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets  
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters  
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores  
And make a sop of all this solid globe:  
Strength should be lord of imbecility,  
And the rude son should strike his father dead:  
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,  
Between whose endless jar justice resides,  
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.  
Then every thing includes itself in power,  
Power into will, will into appetite;  
And appetite, an universal wolf,  
So doubly seconded with will and power,  
Must make perforce an universal prey,  
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,  
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,  
Follows the choking.  
And this neglection of degree it is  
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose  
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd  
By him one step below, he by the next,  
That next by him beneath; so every step,  
Exampled by the first pace that is sick  
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever  
Of pale and bloodless emulation:  


In many ways the previous impeached president, Bill Clinton, was the direct
ancestor of the more recent impeached president. With Clinton we saw "the
dignity of the office" of president undergo serious erosion, with media
discussions of the president's underwear and oral sex with an intern in the
Oval Office. Although the sides were reversed, the reactions were similar to
those produced by Trump: those on the President's side felt he was a "regular
guy" like them (if male), or someone they might hook up with (if female --
reporter Nina Burleigh went so far as to publicly declare she would be happy to
fellate him for keeping abortion legal). Those on the opposite side held him in
contempt, as he lacked the presidential aura that usually lifted the president
slightly above such ???.

Trump, of course, abolished degree more deliberately and more radically than
had Clinton. His constant tweeting made him just another voice on Twitter. His
street-talking belligerence in oral performances led people to see him as
similar to that loud-mouthed guy in their local bar, whom they either found
hilarious or wanted to get banned. Whatever one thinks about whether Trump
*incited* the Capitol Hill riot, he most certainly *inspired* it in this sense:
while I see little evidence that the invaders of the Capitol seriously thought
they were going to "seize power," they most certainly wanted to demonstrate that
they had no *respect* for it, lounging around on the floor of the Senate,
taking selfies in representatives' chairs, stealing the House speaker's podium,
and running around shirtless wearing buffalo horns. And those who condemned
them knew just what was at stake, decrying the violation of the "sacred space"
of the Senate chambers.

The new capitol fencing as an attempt to re-establish degree.

The kicker is that both sides are (partially) right.
As St. Augustine taught us, this the way things are in the City of Man:
it is true that 
degree is artificial, without any substantive basis... and yet we can't do
without it. Without degree, mimetic emulation of "one's betters"
turns into mimetic rivalry among equals, and
the social order turns violent and chaotic. Without belief in a myth that lets
those with less know why those with more deserve it... it is because of their
position in the Great
Chain of Being, or due to the Divine Right of Kings,
or because of a unbroken chain of Lockean just acquisition,
or an expression of the survival of the fittest, or perhaps the fortunate are
the vanguard of the proletariat... those with less will, with increasing
violence, demand their share of the pie. Their demands of an element of justice
in them, but they are hopeless in terms of fixing the problem: in the world of
mimetic rivalry, no one is ever satisfied with just evening the playing field:
no, the oppressed will never stop demanding more until they become the
oppressors in turn.
In the City of Man, purportedly egalitarian
schemes, in fact, only result in replacement of one elite buy another one. The
destruction of the Russian elite of nobility and church hierarchy by the
Bolsheviks did not, in fact, create an egalitarian society: it only created a
new, Bolshevik elite. The French Revolution did not replace the (arbitrary)
rule of the king and nobility with the equality of Man, but with rule 
of Napoleon.

It is only in the City of God that there is an escape from this dilemma.
It is only in the City of God, where mimetic rivalry has been set aside, that
differences of degree can actually be abolished.

“it takes less and less time for more and more people to polarize against more
and more victims for flimsier and flimsier reasons...

“The contagion is such that the entire community is finally divided into two
vast ‘conspiracies’ they can only do one thing: go to war with each other.” —
Sh. 195


Trump’s own behavior contributed to the mimetic escalation in several ways. For
one thing, he was not adverse to scapegoating himself. For instance, well
illegal immigration is certainly a problem America has to address, Trump
sometimes seem to imply that illegal immigrants were about the only problem
America had to address.

“Such a crisis can only be regarded as the responsibility of all citizens… In
no case can this crisis be the responsibility of a single individual, however
powerful he happens to be.” Sh 207
