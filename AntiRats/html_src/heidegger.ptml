            <p>

            Heidegger argues that the overly reductionist approach of the
            natural sciences, since 1850, renders it blind to the essential
            character of nature. Instead of revealing nature to us, modern
            scientific thinking conceals nature behind the veil of its own
            interests, interests driven by the quest for technological mastery
            over nature and circumscribed by its mathematical method. This
            chapter reconstructs Heidegger’s general critique of modern
            math-based science by focusing on how the scientific thinking
            informs thinking in general, how it dictates the way objects
            appear, the character of causation and free will, and the character
            of science now that it has come under the sway of technological
            thinking.  While the chapter does not investigate Heidegger’s
            solutions to this problem, a brief discussion of Plato’s notion of
            wonder, as the basis of philosophical thinking, points us in the
            direction of a new, or perhaps old, way of thinking.
