            The aim of this project is to provide an overview of the many
            critics of Enlightenment rationalism. The essays on each thinker
            are intended not merely to offer an overview of that thinker, but
            also to place him or her in the context of this larger stream of
            anti-rationalist thought.

            Some my wonder at the mixed bag of thinkers we address: poets,
            philosophers, economists, mathematicians, novelists, political
            theorists, urbanists, and philosophers. But there is unity in this
            diversity.

            As I think I have shown in my work on Oakeshott, his
            political criticism of rationalism sprang directly from his
            philosophical view of the modes of experience: the rationalist in
            politics was guilty of an ignoratio elenchi. And what would a
            general critique would be but a philosophical one expressed without
            technical philosophical language. When Eliot writes of men
            "dreaming of systems so perfect that no one has to be good," he is
            expressing in poetry what Oakeshott expressed in verse. (And they
            share a common source in Bradley!)
