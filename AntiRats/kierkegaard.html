<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
Søren Kierkegaard needs no introduction as a critic of Enlightenment
rationalism: he is commonly regarded as an apolitical “irrationalist” who is
obsessed with the individual’s encounter with the absurd (MacIntyre 1981;
Pojman 1984). My paper will argue that this view obscures Kierkegaard’s
critique of political rationalism, and work to bring Kierkegaard’s political
critique of rationalism to light.
</p>
<p>
My essay breaks new ground, I hope, because I am interested in Kierkegaard’s
anti-rationalism as a political philosopher. But is also a synthetic piece. I
hope to weave a synthetic view of more specific arguments I have made about
“irrationalism” and the leap of faith (in 2013), the passions of the public
sphere (in 2014), and the importance of the passion of wonder to Kierkegaard
(in 2015).
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other philosophers interested in Kierkegaard’s anti-rationalism, I
    bring his political and pastoral writings to bear on his critique of
    rationalism. I shall argue that, of all things in the great individualist
    decrier of world-historical thinking, these writings unexpectedly provide a
    history of philosophy and social history backdrop in which to see
    Kierkegaard. In a nutshell, we learn that after the French Revolution the
    attitude philosophical rationalism—from Descartes’s radical doubt to
    Hegel’s Absolute Idea—has come to permeate the political public sphere. The
    demand for facts and certain knowledge unfortunately imperils the wonder
    whence all philosophy, poetry, ethics, and religion comes. Like a Rousseau
    or a Nietzsche, Kierkegaard has a psychological counterattack: the
    thoroughgoing doubt of philosophical rationalism requires a passionate
    motivation. Kierkegaard finds that motivation in envy.
</p>

<h2>
Scope and method of the paper
</h2>

<p>
I focus on four books that Kierkegaard wrote between 1842 and 1845. I begin
with the famous Johannes Climacus writings, Philosophical Fragments (1844),
which describes the famous so-called ‘leap of faith.’ This is the central work
for those who argue Kierkegaard’s doctrine is that the will can and ought to
affirm absurd propositions despite objective evidence and logical
contradictions. Important work by philosophers (e.g., Evans 1989, Ferreira
1991) has been done to correct—in my view, perhaps to overcorrect (see Wyllie
2013)—exaggerated views of Kierkegaard’s anti-rationalism. While the precise
nature of of Kierkegaard’s anti-rationalism is much discussed, the assumption
of his apoliticism remains largely uncorrected
</p>
<p>
To illuminate the political character of Kierkegaard’s anti-rationalism, I turn
to three additional and comparatively neglected works written soon before and
after Philosophical Fragments:
</p>
<p>
(1)	I argue that, for starters, we must understand the “leap of faith” in light
of Kierkegaard’s unfinished Johannes Climacus (1842). Since Kierkegaard
expected his notebooks to be read, we have a warrant to read the Climacus
writings as if they are written by a mature version the literary character
described in Johannes Climacus, namely, an enthusiastic young philosophy
student who wants to know where to start in philosophy. Johannes contrasts the
ancients’ receptivity to wonder to the post-Cartesians’ rationalist obsession
with an absolute method that has an indubitable starting point. This is thinly
veiled autobiography at points: Kierkegaard went to hear Schelling lecture in
Berlin in 1841 excited for precisely the promise of a ‘positive philosophy’
rather than a thoroughgoing rationalist ‘negative philosophy’ critical of any
knowledge that cannot be systematically demonstrated to be certain and
indubitable. I should add that this work has received important attention in
political theory, because of the political stakes of Kierkegaard’s opposition
to Descartes (Arendt 1958).
</p>
<p>
(2)	Soon after writing Philosophical Fragments, Kierkegaard turns most
explicitly to politics in his critique of the public sphere in Two Ages. In
1913, Theodor Haecker translated its most politically incisive sections were
translated into German (as Kritik der Gegenwart), which explains the outsize
stature of Kierkegaard as a political thinker in Weimar Germany, and his
political reception by thinkers as diverse as Karl Jaspers, Carl Schmitt,
Martin Heidegger, Leo Strauss, Hannah Arendt (Janik 1984). Two Ages criticizes
the public sphere. Much like the method of radical doubt in modern philosophy,
the public sphere habituates jaded and skeptical human beings. Kierkegaard
reveals that the religious is imperiled by the loss of wonder from the public
world (Wyllie 2014).
</p>
<p>
(3)	Finally, I turn to the most obscure writing from 1844, Two Upbuilding
Discourses, a meditation on Luke 2:33-40 written simultaneously with
Philosophical Fragments. Kierkegaard wishes to recover a Christian view of life
that is receptive to wonder, as life is but ‘a nightwatch of expectancy’ (see
Wyllie 2015). And in these remarkable writings, Kierkegaard reveals that the
attack upon wonder has been launched by envy. It is our envy of God and one
another that motivates the overextension of philosophical doubt (e.g.,
rationalists exclude all phenomena that do not fit their methodological
criteria) and makes us prone to gainsay our fellow citizens. In my view, these
earnest pastoral writings that criticize the radical doubt of philosophical
rationalism for influencing the public realm after the French Revolution, and
inoculating individuals against wonder. And the ‘upbuilding discourses’
ironically confirm Kierkegaard’s bleak conspectus of political rationalism,
disenchantment that not only fortifies atheistic despair, but political
despair: it precludes the political excellence of great speeches and deeds as
well.

<h2>
What does Kierkegaard’s critique of political rationalism get us?
</h2>
<p>
I think it is easy to see why Kierkegaard’s critique of political rationalism,
in his brief admission to political theory in Weimar Germany, was received as a
strident critique of liberal democracy. There is no way around the historical
facts that Kierkegaard, a reactionary amidst the revolutions of 1848 (Kirmmse
1997), inspires antidemocratic politics in the next century. Scholars can
acknowledge this and still use Kierkegaard as a resource for a more
emancipatory agenda (for those who do, see Ryan 2014, 3). But I want to say
that there is an important lesson in an unfashionable constituent feature of
Kierkegaard’s reactionary politics, namely his political anti-rationalism. In
our own times, Kierkegaard’s critique should inspire a caution that ulterior
psychological motives—envy is a more obscure ulterior motive than the ulterior
strategic considerations about wealth and power that concern Jürgen
Habermas—haunt rational political discourse. But it should also inspire
citizens to rise from envy, to encounter others with curiosity and receptivity.
Kierkegaard is an ambivalent figure: in his own lifetime, the strident critique
of an envious philosophy and politics would produce not only withering
critiques of democratic politics-as-usual but also his 1850 masterpiece on
sociality and otherness, Works of Love.
</p>
<p>
Like other radical critics in the modern philosophical tradition, Kierkegaard
opens questions that are dangerous to ask Kierkegaard becomes the anonymized
“Protestant theologian” of Schmitt’s state of exception (Political Theology
2005, 15; Löwith 1991); Heidegger takes his concept of the public-sphere
“leveling” [Nivellierung] of Das Man in Being and Time directly from
Kierkegaard’s Two Ages [nivellering]. However, I would insist that those others
that take the weight of his critique—perhaps take is more seriously—might
nonetheless have different attitudes towards liberal democracy. The Weimar
critic that Kierkegaard inspired probably the most deeply, Theodor Haecker,
went on to be ‘court philosopher’ not to the Hitler regime, but to the White
Rose student resistance. In fact, Kierkegaard’s criticism of political
ratonalism informs a range of attitudes: from a cautious defense of liberal
democracy (like Jaspers), perhaps one informed by a sharp understanding of the
theologico-political problem (like Strauss), or even a more radical desire for
the reenchantment of public life (like Arendt).
