        The Voyage to Laputa in Book III of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> contains a
        pivotal facet of Swift’s attack on the emergent modernist project as he
        saw it: the New Science characterized by the experimental philosophy of
        the Royal Society of London and the University of Leiden. The aim of
        this chapter is to connect the underlining goals and ambitions of the
        New Science to other relevant tracts in the emergent Enlightenment
        order of nascent liberal individualism featured in Swift’s
        Counter-Enlightenment critique of travel. As the ideas of Rationalism
        crystallised in the early eighteenth century, the assumptions of
        liberalism concerning travel coalesced around a vital spoke of the
        emergent Enlightenment, that of the experimental science.
        <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>
        offers a stern warning as to the risks that accompany free-form
        travel that assumes beneficial experiential edification in all
        circumstances. Science offers a form of order or discipline upon
        travel, but travel moulded to the demands of empirical observation for
        the purposes of scientific discovery is equally undesirable. This is
        because, as Swift shows in the Voyage to Laputa, the scientific
        worldview possesses the capacity to be inhuman in its singular
        obsession with speculation and abstraction, hubristically viewing all
        its exploits under the banner of the triumphant march of so-called
        progress. Swift demonstrates that science carries an absolutist
        tendency that can easily bleed into politics, hastily rationalising a
        drastic overhaul of society in accordance with its aims.
