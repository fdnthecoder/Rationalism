        This essay will explore Fyodor M. Dostoevsky's confrontation with
        enlightenment rationalism as manifest in the modern scientific approach
        to politics and political science. Whereas modern political science
        aims to regress all humans to the mean, Dostoevsky asks us not to
        forgot those folks who might be called outliers. Outliers are often the
        forgotten folk who make little difference in the story the statistical
        models try to tell. For Dostoevsky, these outliers are often hiding in
        the little spaces below the floorâ€”and this is the lesson of the
        Underground Man in his <i>Notes from the Underground</i>. This essay will
        therefore analyze the place of outliers--be they hermits, heroes, or
        demagogues--in Dostoevsky's distinctly Russian view of "Western"
        rationalism. Western rationalism, I will argue, is for Dostoevsky, the
        Baal that terrified him as he stood before the Crystal Palace at
        London's Universal Exhibition of 1862.
