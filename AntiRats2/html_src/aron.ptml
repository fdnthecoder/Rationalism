        Drawing on <i>The Opium of the Intellectuals and other writings</i>,
        this
        chapter examines Raymond Aron’s criticism of the revolutionary left in
        light of Aristotle’s treatment of the intellectual virtues in Book VI
        of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. Aron delineates the errors of the
        revolutionary left in terms that may be understood as involving: (1) an
        episteme that is really only an ideology—or a combination of
        ideologies, economical, value-driven, and pseudo-theological—that
        reason upon false premises to fabricate conclusions they feign
        necessary; (2) a pretended <i>techne</i> that is at best cleverness (but only
        cynically, supposing the tyranny they manufacture is intended), since
        it is impossible to construct the ideal world they pretend to design
        and promise to realize because their treatment of the matter with which
        they work (whether respect to human and inanimate nature) is partial at
        best, and their account of its motions and transformations through time
        (i.e., history) is mythical; (3) the absence or outright rejection of
        <i>phronesis</i>, allowing persons intoxicated on abstractions to imagine
        themselves capable of imposing systemic fixes on the world without
        consideration for the constitution of the souls of the people they
        would manipulate, or the consequences of their manipulations upon them;
        and (4) the absence of <i>nous</i>, because their faith is fundamentally
        nihilistic, assuming or at least insisting that there really is no
        reality or truth, empirical or normative, that cannot be radically
        refashioned on the basis of will and imagination so as to suit their
        vision. All of these factors combine to produce a doctrine and project
        altogether lacking in <i>sophia</i>.
