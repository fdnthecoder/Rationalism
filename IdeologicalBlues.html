		<h1>
			They Woke Up This Morning, They Had Those Ideological Blues
		</h1>

            <p>
                Recently, in the United States, as well as in much of Europe,
                and many other areas of the world as well, what is often called
                "woke" ideology has had significant influence, as well as
                having been the object of much criticism. What I want to argue,
                in this essay, is that:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    While woke ideology, of course, has its own, unique
                    characteristics, it nevertheless shares many features of
                    the many other "political religions" that have arisen over
                    the last several centuries.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Recognizing those common characteristics is beneficial to
                    those who wish to protect social order from the
                    pathenogenic effects of all political religions (or, as we
                    shall also designate them, "ideologies").
                </li>

                <li>
                    Identifying such commonalities among the political
                    religions (ideologies) could, most hopefully, even aid
                    those suffering from infection by one or the other of them
                    in recognizing that from which they suffer, and point the
                    way towards a healing from such an affliction.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Like many words in the English language, "ideology" has more
                than one meaning. I am going to use it in a particular sense,
                not because I think every other sense is wrong, but only because
                I think that the sense with which I will use it
                is illuminative. The definition I offer
                of ideology is drawn from the works of Eric Voegelin, and
                goes:
            </p>

            <p>
                "An ideology is a collection of postulates for constructing and
                keeping intact a second reality."
            </p>

            <p>
                By a "second reality" is meant a fantasy, a dream world, a wish
                about how the world <i>really ought to be</i>. Now, all
                practical action seeks to replace what is with what ought to
                be: if, in 1870, I "dream" of a bridge across the East River, I
                may be able to succeed in getting the Brooklyn Bridge
                constructed. But I can only do so by accepting the truth of
                reality as it is when I have my dream: there is no bridge at
                present, to construct one is going to take a lot of resources
                and some great engineering, I must work to persuade many people
                it is feasible, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difference between this and an ideological "second reality"
                is that in the latter case, what we have is not a practical
                plan for moving from the current, realistically appraised state
                of the world, to a different, state, deemed more desirable, but
                a <i>denial</i> of reality as it is, and the attempt to blot
                out that reality with the magical invocation of an alternate
                reality in which essential aspects of "first" reality are
                banished by incantation. For instance, Marxism is not a
                reality-based, practical plan for improving the conditions of
                the working class -- Marx and Engels despised such efforts --
                it is an attempt to replace the real world, in which life is
                hard and people suffer for a myriad of reasons, with a fantasy
                world, in which life is simple and endlessly joyous... or at
                least it <i>would</i> be, if not for the existence of those
                rotten capitalists.
            </p>

            <p>
                This brings us to a second aspect of an ideology (as Voegelin
                used the term): given that there is an obvious discrepancy
                between the actual world and the ideological dream world, what
                explains this divergence? Ideologies seem to generally explain
                this gulf by asserting that their dream world <i>would</i> be
                real, if not for the existence of some nefarious group
                working to block its realization. For Marxists, this is the
                capitalists. For Nazis, it is the Jews. For neoconservatives,
                it is those who "hate our American values." And for the current
                "woke," it is "white, cisgendered males." And the obvious
                corollary of such a finding is, "Well, if we could just
                eliminate all of the [fill in the evil group here], then the
                dream world would become real!"
            </p>

            <p>
                The final, general consideration I want to introduce here is
                how the "arguments" that make up an essential part of an
                ideology are not really "arguments" at all, in that they are
                not attempts to rationally respond to criticisms of the
                ideology. Rather, they are defensive measures designed to
                prevent reality from penetrating the ideological dream world.
                This point is most easily understood by considering some
                examples.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few years ago, I was struck by a poster hanging in the
                hallway of the insitution in which I was teaching at that time.
                The poster showed a legless person sitting in a wheelchair, and
                under that image, in large text, was written,
                "My only disability is in your mind." Now, the members of the
                human race present to us a glorious variety of abilities and
                disabilities. I, for instance, am only 5'9" tall, and not much
                of a jumper. I don't for a moment believe that these
                limitations of mine make me less of a person than someone who
                is 7'1" tall, and who can leap like a rabbit. But it would be
                absurd to say that "My only disability to play as a center in
                the NBA exists in your mind." No, I'm (relatively) short, and
                don't jump that well: these are very real shortcomings for
                playing center in the NBA, and they certainly do
                <i>not</i> exist only in the mind of NBA scouts!
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, I will note that I am strongly in favor of helping
                out those who have a disability such as having no legs, by, for
                instance, building wheel chair ramps to enable them to access
                buildings where they could not climb the stairs to get in. But
                look, the very fact that we ought to build such ramps, when
                feasible, testifies to the fact that these disabilities are
                <i>not</i> only "in the mind" of the "ableists," but actually
                exist in reality. After all, if the wheelchair-bound person's
                disabilities were actually "only in our minds," then all we
                would have to do to get the person in the building would be to
                stop thinking that they had any problem getting in! No ramp
                would be needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                So let us examine what purpose this slogan ("my disabilities
                exist only in your mind") serves. First of all, it is a bit of
                raw material in the construction of a "second reality," in
                which not having legs, or being blind, or being only 5'9" and
                not a very good jumper, are not <i>facts of reality</i> but,
                instead, are merely the arbitrary <i>beliefs</i> of some
                "privileged" social group which has legs, or is "sighted,"
                or is tall and can jump. But what's more, and I what think is
                even more important, is that it serves as part of a defensive
                shield that protects the ideological second reality from being
                dissolved by exposure to reality itself. <i>The preponderance
                of the contents of an ideological system</i> consists of
                ritualized responses to any interrogation of the system's
                assumptions. Such responses protect the adherent of the
                ideology from having to rationally engage in discussion with
                anyone who has not already embraced the ideology's dream
                reality. So, for instance, any person possessed of a normal
                degree of common sense, encountering a poster like the one I
                described above, would be likely to say, "But wait a second:
                that person in the picture has no legs: certainly that makes
                doing many things I take for granted as routine extremely
                difficult for that person!" (And that common-sensical person,
                if possessed of a minimal degree of charity, might furthermore
                entertain the idea that, "Thus, we should really try to give
                that person, lacking legs, a hand in getting through life!")
                But no! The "anti-abelist" ideologue responds, "The fact that
                you think the person depicted in our poster has some inherent
                problems dealing with stairs, 100-meter dashes, or what have
                you, is just a symptom of your oppresive, ableist mindset!"
                The crucial fact to recognize here is that the response of the
                ideologue to any criticism arising from outside of the
                ideologue's second reality is <i>not</i> an attempt to
                rationally engage in dialogue with the critic: it is simply a
                <i>defense mechanism</i> functioning to protect the ideological
                second reality from dissolution due to exposure to the facts of
                primary reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                I think it is important to note that this understanding of
                ideologies (with its genesis in the thought of Voegelin, as
                well as Aristotle, Oakeshott, and many others), is not a
                "partisan," "conservative" strategy for dismissing all
                "leftist" thought. Quite to the contrary, this critique of
                ideological thinking cuts across conventional "left-right"
                boundaries, and is shared by, for instance, a left-leaning
                semi-anarchist such as James C. Scott. What's more, it can
                equally be used to critique "right-wing" ideologies, such as
                neo-conservatism, or doctrinaire belief in the unmitigated
                beneficence of "unfettered" free markets. For example, many
                neo-conservative ideologues forward a "dream world" in which
                the United States has always and everywhere been a force for
                peace and justice, and in which the only reasons America has
                not been able to reach the "end of history" in a perfect,
                global republic of universal, democratic capitalism is the
                opposition to this earthly paradise on the part of
                "Islamo-fascists" and other reactionaries, such as "Russian
                authoritarians" or "Christian fundamentalists." If it is
                pointed out to them that, perhaps, Iranians who suffered under
                the autocratic rule of the US-supported Shah, or Filipinos
                whose relatives died fighting the American efforts to
                "Christianize" the Phillipines (which had been Catholic for 300
                years by the time the US sought to Christianize them), or ...?,
                might be skeptical of plans to place the entire globe under US
                hegemony, the person noting this will be accused of "hating
                America." This "comeback" serves the same purpose as the
                response to the "ableist" described in the previous paragraph:
                neither are attempts to rationally engage the critic
                of the ideology in question. No, both serve, instead, to
                <i>dismiss</i> the voice of any outsider criticizing any aspect
                of the ideology in question: such critics most emphatically
                should <i>not</i> be heard, because to actually engage their
                critique would be to give encouragement to... well, whatever
                enemy the ideology in question has identified as the demonic
                resistance to the establishment of paradise on earth: perhaps
                it is "the capitalists," or "the Jews," or "the
                Islamo-fascists," or "the patriarchists," or "the
                cis-gendered," or... well, you get the idea!
            </p>

            <p>
                To see that the ideology virus is not particularly a left or
                right wing disease, and that identifying it is not a partisan
                campaign, but a mission of public service, I think it will be
                helpful to look at several more examples. In each, we will see
                that the ideological response to reasonable criticism is
                <i>not</i> an attempt to engage with or rationally refute the
                critic, but instead is a way to erect a defensive shield that
                renders the ideology impenetrable to criticism from outside.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first example has little to do with politics, and the
                adherents of this dream world, in fact, range all over the
                "political spectrum." Their dream world insists that
                "computation," something many of them understand well, as this
                ideology is particularly popular with programmers and other
                computer professionals, is an all-encompassing description of
                reality. A mathematician friend of mine, faced with a
                "computationalist" ideologue, asked, "Well, don't you think
                <i>Pi</i> is real?" The response he got was, "If you think
                noncomputable numbers are real, then prove it by computing one
                of them for me." Quite clearly, from any reasonable point of
                view, this response is complete nonsense: if someone thinks
                that a non-computable number like <i>Pi</i> or <i>e</i> is
                real, they are claiming that these numbers are real, <i>despite
                the fact that they cannot be computed</i> (because their
                decimal expansion is infinite and non-repeating). To demand
                that such a person prove that these non-computable numbers
                really exist by computing them is like asking that someone
                prove that there are living dodo birds by shooting them and
                bringing in their corpses. Given the complete irrationality of
                this response, it should be clear that its purpose wasn't to
                rationally engage with this argument against computationalism,
                but rather to block it, and prevent it from disturbing the
                dream world of the computationalist.

                To turn to a more political example, in one of Rod Dreher's
                recent blog posts at TAC
                (https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/queering-children-imaginations-rudolph-drag-queen-story-hour/),
                he objected to a public school bringing a drag queen who had
                worked as a prostitute into the school to read stories to young
                children, one commenter responded:
                "You don't want your children to even know that gay people
                exist."
                This response is, quite obviously, not an effort to seriously
                engage Dreher's case that "inviting drag queen prostitutes to
                read to young children might be a bad idea": to jump from that
                to "you don't want your children to even know that gay people
                exist" makes no rational sense. So why in the world would a
                commenter post this? Once again, we are witnessing an ideology
                as consisting of "postulates for constructing and keeping
                intact a second reality." The postulate in play here is that
                any person who objects to any aspect of the ongoing sexual
                revolution, whatever their argument might be, in reality is
                just a reactionary puritan. The utility of adopting this stance
                is that the adoptor never needs to address any actual arguments
                put forward by anyone who dissents from their ideology: no
                need, such people are just repressed neurotics who wish to
                impose their own inability to "realize themselves as sexual
                beings" on to others. Given this identification of the foe as
                "oppresive other," the need to deal with any of their actual
                arguments is swepy away.

                Coming to recognize the pernicious effects of all ideologies,
                of all attempts to act as though one's dream world were real,
                and reality only a conspiracy foisted on us by some Satanic
                foes of everyone else's happiness,
                does not entail supporting (or resisting) Donald Trump,
                embracing (or opposing) Brexit, rejecting (or advocating) the
                existence of the Federal Reserve, voting for (or against)
                affirmative action, working to lower (or raise) tax rates, or,
                in general, adopting any particular policy positions or
                political platforms at all. Rather, once we reject the siren
                song of ideologies offering easy answers to the complex
                problems of the real world, we can accept that fixing those
                problems is usually difficult and fraught with unforeseen side
                effects, that our own judgement of the best way to address them
                is only
