            Abstract
            </h2>
            
            <p>
                In countless public speeches and pieces of private
                correspondence, Thomas Jefferson proclaimed the innate goodness
                and rationality of human beings. He believed governments
                propped up by irrational claims of authority, particularly the
                “monkish ignorance” of religious authority, had subverted these
                qualities too often. Diminished liberty and pervasive despair
                prevailed throughout the world. Fortunately, a new science of
                politics, one grounded in reason rather than superstition,
                offered hope because it allowed for the discovery of a rational
                foundation for government worthy of the people it would serve.
                Although the United States was the first country to implement a
                regime based on reason, Jefferson sincerely expected America to
                inspire other nations, and, eventually, all nations, to embrace
                the new rationalism and trust their people with
                self-governance. Sentiments such as these have led many
                political theorists, historians, and regular citizens to view
                Jefferson as an embodiment of American political idealism, love
                for humanity, and faith in reason.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Jefferson, reason provided access to the truth about
                reality and initiated a desperately needed break from a
                decadent past filled with incense and nonsense. Reason was the
                guide to progress as well as the means to ending history
                itself. Friedrich Nietzsche would find much to object to in
                these areas of Jefferson’s political thought. In many writings,
                Nietzsche skewered modern rationalism as a manifestation of
                will to power masquerading as a disinterested pursuit of
                objective truths about reality. The pretensions of rationalism
                notwithstanding, Nietzsche held that its will to truth did not
                inaugurate a break from the religious past so much as it
                re-packaged pre-existing ethical and political beliefs in
                language stripped of theological and metaphysical associations.
                Thus, modern rationalism was no new thing under the sun; it
                suffered from a serious problem Nietzsche already identified in
                the religious past that he, like Jefferson, sought to
                transcend: misanthropy and world hatred.

                In this chapter, Nietzsche’s views regarding will to truth,
                will to power, and ascetic ideals will be connected to his
                criticisms of modern rationalism. These conceptual tools will
                then be applied to an explanation and analysis of the relevant
                elements of Jefferson’s political thought. By borrowing
                Nietzsche’s hammer to “sound out” Jefferson’s mind, it will be
                argued that Jefferson’s oft-celebrated optimism, rationalism,
                and esteem for the people are symptoms of misanthropy and world
                hatred, that is, nihilism. Because many see Jefferson as a
                paradigmatic figure in the American Founding, even as an
                incarnation of the American spirit, the chapter has broad
                implications for interpreting a fundamental dimension of the
                American political tradition.
