# Woke Sorcery

Gene Callahan

It may seem bizarre to analyze any current world events as involving sorcery:
surely, sorcery is something that was never real, and attempts at sorcery
disappeared hundreds of years ago.

To the contrary, the political philosopher Eric Voegelin demonstrated that many
of the new political ideologies that have arisen during the recent three
centuries have, in fact, been efforts to change the world by casting a spell of
words over it.

Voegelin aimed his analysis chiefly at 19th-century thinkers such as Hegel,
Marx, and Comte. He notes that Hegel, in particular, quite clearly saw himself
as a sorcerer, as he talked about his *Zauberworte* (magic words) and his
*Zauberkraft* (magic force), that would transform reality.

But Voegelin's analysis applies equally well to more modern sorcerers.
I myself fell into the enchantment of the spell of one of them:
that spell, called "Scientology," cast by L. Ron Hubbard.
After two years, I was able to break free of the spell only when presented with
an analysis of how such a spell could be cast: once that happened, I realized
that Hubbard had literally entrapped me in a net woven by his words.

The analysis of sorcery that enabled me to understand what Hubbard was doing
was provided to me by Carlos Castañeda, in his discussion of "the second ring
of power," in books that quite explicitly were about sorcery. I have no idea if
Castañeda had ever read Voegelin, but it is interesting that Voegelin posited
that sorcery was an attempt to create a "second reality." (Some readers may be
inclined to think that, in using Castañeda to understand Hubbard, I was using one
nutjob to break free from another, but so be it: I am just reporting what really
happened.)
 
But what is this "second ring of power," or "second reality"? It is a reality
created by a spell of words, that is supposed to be more real than the primary
reality that we encounter every day.

How in the world could a "sorcerer" create such a "second reality" or possibly
make living in it it seem preferable to living in primary reality?

The first thing a sorcerer must do is seduce his acolytes into the secondary
reality by offering some genuine insights about the nature of primary reality.
So, for instance, Hegel, a brilliant scholar of the history of philosophy,
could offer his readers novel perspectives on the development of the subject.
Marx, who was a keen observer of the social scene around him, could provide
genuine insights into mid-19th-century European social relations. Hubbard, who
had studied Buddhism, psychoanalysis, and cybernetics, could offer potential
acolytes an interesting perspective on their psychological difficulties with
what he called "Dianetics." The genuine improvements
many people made with Dianetic processing lured them into Scientology. Ayn
Rand, another modern sorcerer, had absorbed much of Aristotle, and had personal
experience with collectivist tyranny in the USSR, and thus could offer real
insights into collectivist madness.

Voegelin describes this feature of sorcerers' construction of a dreamworld:
"Replacing the first reality of experience by the second reality of imaginative
construction, and endowing the imaginary reality with the appearance of truth
by letting it absorb pieces of first reality" ("On Hegel," page 224).

And Voegelin notes that this sort of sorcery is far more widespread than just
the few thinkers I have mentioned: 
it is "the great confidence game played by modern man... under such titles as
advertisement, propaganda, communication, and comprehensively, as ideological
politics" (OH, p. 225).

Thus, ideologies gain their plausibility because they have genuinely pointed at
something that is really a problem, say "racism" or "capitalist exploitation."
But typically they try to treat this *one* problem as if it were the source
of *all* problems.

The truths offered by a sorcerer, however, only serve as lures, inviting
acolytes into the sorcerer’s second reality. Once "hooked" by these lures,
the apprentice is then "educated" into a whole new way of viewing the world.
This new vision is made attractive by the assertion on the part of the sorcerer
that those who have embraced it are now superior to the run-of-the-mill
humanity who have not done so. For example, followers of Hegel are told that
they are at the forefront of the historical development of *geist*, or the
"world spirit." Discussing Hegel, Voegelin observes: "Hegel's obsession was
power. If he wanted to be the sorcerer who could evoke the shape of history, he
had to penetrate the political events of the time with thought until the events
and thought would coincide" (OH, 235).

Similarly, the most diehard Marxists are assured that they are "the vanguard of
the proletariat." The devotees of Hubbard were promised that they could become
"operating thetans," acquiring capabilities not available to
non-Scientologists.  And a Randian hero might live a life of freedom in "Galt's
Gulch."

But these are promises about the future: the sorcerer's apprentice also gets a
more immediate payoff: the conviction that they are now privy to previously
hidden knowledge about how the world "really" is structured. The newly minted
Marxist can "see" that class struggle is what *really* drives human affairs.
The Randian acolyte now perceives the pernicious influence of "moochers"
everywhere. As a new Scientologist, I was informed that I possessed superior
knowledge of where people were on the "tone scale,"
and I would be able to spot "supressive personalities." And, to jump ahead a
little, the imbiber of critical race theory is enlightened to the "fact" that
"white supremacy" is the key to understanding all things American.  For someone
floundering in the troubled waters of a society in flux, this assurance of
special insight into reality is a tremendous boost to one's self-image.

To ensure the reader does not dismiss this analysis of sorcery as some sort of
"right-wing" tactic to smear leftists -- although Rand was hardly on the left!
-- I will cite another recent example of sorcery:
what is often called "neoconservatism." The
secondary reality neoconservatives have attempted to create is one in which all
actions by the United States are, by definition, virtuous, and all people,
all around the world, have as their deepest aspiration to become American.

Ron Suskind reported on a conversation with a (neoconservative)
Bush administration official as follows:

"The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based
community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from
your judicious study of discernible reality.' [...] 'That's not the way the
world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we
act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that
reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we'll act again, creating other new realities,
which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's
actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.'"

It is stunning how explicit this official was about ignoring the primary
reality of experience and creating "our own reality." If one were to write a
fictional character intended to exemplify Voegelin's concept of sorcery, and
put those words in his mouth, a critic would probably call it too hamhanded,
a caricature of the ideologue.

The promise of being able to create one's own reality is
very seductive: As Voegelin noted, "Once you have
entered into the magic circle the sorcerer has drawn around himself, you are
lost" (OH, 228).

Having examined the general nature of sorcery, and of the *Zauberworte*, the
magic words sorcerers use to cast their spell, we can proceed to look at the
specific case of "woke sorcery."

We can begin with an old example.
Although the "woke" have not recently paid much attention to mental
disabilities, being more recently concerned with racial and sexual issues,
they still devote some attention to "ableism," by which they seem to mean the
suggestion that people with some handicap have a handicap.
On the particular topic of mental handicaps, Rick Hodges writes:

"In 1910, the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for
Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons adopted three classifications of people we
know today as intellectually disabled, as defined by a newly invented way to
measure intelligence we now call the IQ test. 'Morons' were the most
intelligent — they had IQs between 50 and 70. 'Imbeciles' with IQs between 25
and 50 were the second level. Those below 25 would remain 'idiots.'"
(https://humanparts.medium.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-mentally-retarded-e3b9eea23018)

But these terms -- and "moron" was a brand new one,  with no prior meaning --
gradually came to be insults. So they were replaced with "mentally retarded" --
until "retarded" also became an insult. So "intellectually disabled" was in,
and "retarded" came to be regarded as "hate speech."

In primary reality, what is genuinely important is that those
of us with normal mental capacities should
exercise kindness and compassion towards those who are not so blessed, and
realize that it is no accomplishment of our own, for instance, not to be born
with Down's Syndrome.  But *that* involves a change of heart, and is more
difficult to accomplish than is a change in terminology.

Too many people feel the intellect they have been gifted with is somehow their own
accomplishment, and thus feel entitled to those who have not been equally
gifted. Tellingly, Hodges himself does not recommend this change of heart, but
instead recommends a *new* form of word magic: simply asserting that a
disability is not really a disability; just insist, he says, that there is
"nothing wrong" with being mentally retarded. This "solution" is just as nonsensical
as is the "euphemism treadmill" of continually changing words:
of course, there is *something* wrong with someone who has an "intellectual
disability": they have more than ordinary trouble learning new things, just as
there is something wrong with someone who is blind: they can't see.
Only a belief in *Zauberworte* could result in someone thinking that
the only problem a person with an IQ of 30 has is that others think there is
something wrong with him. But the person is nevertheless a child of God, and
fully worthy of our love whatever disability they suffer from. Furthermore,
there is "something wrong" with all of us, which should make us pause if we
contemplate mocking or taking advantage of what is wrong with someone else.

A similar migration of terms has gone on in regards to the... well, they were
once "hobos" or "vagrants," then they became "the homeless," and now they are
"the unhoused." The attempt to address social ills by word magic is also
apparent in the shifting terms by which it is considered acceptable to refer to
people of sub-Saharan African descent. "Negro" was once fine, but was replaced
by "colored," as in the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People." But then "colored" was denigrated, and "black" became correct. Then
"black" was out, and "African-American" was de rigueur.

The last term was so strongly promoted at one time, especially in our schools,
that my then young son, knowing that I had studied Ghanian music, asked me,
"Aren't most of the people in Ghana African-American?"

"No," I told him, "most of them are African-African."

And the use of the new term certainly did not stop people from stereotyping.
Once, my next-door-neighbor (herself a "favored minority" in at least two
senses!) called me up while I was at work, and told me, "A truck pulled up in
your driveway... and a bunch of *African-Americans* got out of it... I'm
worried you're being robbed."

In fact, this was a tree-cutting crew I had hired. But notice how my neighbor,
in her racial stereotyping, was careful to use the then politically correct
term for the men she saw, as though such word magic could erase the
stereotyping.

But today, "African-American" is out, and "Black," with a capital "B," is in.
This ridiculous dance from word to word for describing the same group of people
illustrates the attractiveness of belief in word magic. Certainly, there remain
white Americans who are genuine racists. And anyone of good will should strive
to disabuse them of their ignorance. But the notion that we can make progress
on this front by continually changing the word by which we refer to the subject
of their prejudice ought to be dismissed as laughable... unless one has fallen
under the spell of a sorcerer.

A curious example of word magic amongst "anti-racists" (which means people who
think about almost nothing but race) is the notion of "racist dog whistle,"
or "coded" racist messages.
Plain-old dog whistles, of course, are designed to make a sound at a pitch that
dogs can hear, but humans cannot. By analogy, a racist dog whistle is some
"coded" phrase by which racists can identify as such to other racists, but that
non-racists will mistake for some innocent language. (For example, just the
other day I heard a wokester claim that the phrase "civilized society" is a dog
whistle, as though traditional Asian, African, and American Indian societies
had no standards of civility!)
A dog whistle is a sort of "secret Masonic handshake," but for racists.

The difficulty here arises from the fact that anti-racists continually claim to
be able to "hear" these dog whistles, quite distinctly. But if they are
designed to be recognizable only by racists... then wouldn't the woke who hear
them have to be racist themselves? "No," they respond, "we have just studied
these racists and broken their code." But in that case, wouldn't the racists
pick a *new* code, one that hasn't been broken? When the Allies broke a German
code in WWII, they were very careful to hide the fact, so that the Germans
would keep using the (now useless) code. But the woke declare publicly, every
hour of every day, on Twitter, on Facebook, and in woke journals, that they
can decipher the racists' code. Are we supposed to imagine that the racists are
clever enough to disguise their racism in seemingly innoccuous phrases like
"civilized society," and yet too stupid to change their code once it has been
so thoroughly and publicly exposed? And if someone is tempted to respond,
"Well, of course, racists are stupid!", they might contemplate the fact that
pretty much no one ever has been as racist as the Nazis running Germany during
World War II, and yet those racists were diabolically clever at fighting a war,
and the Allied codebreakers, as noted, went to great lengths to *hide* the fact
they had broken Nazi codes.

No, no serious explanation for this conundrum is forthcoming. And that is
because this is not a serious theory about secret communication channels, but a
use of word magic to "curse" those whose views the woke disagree with by
attaching the stigma of racism to them: just call anything someone says, that
you don't like, a "racist dog whistle," and there you have it: no need to even
address whatever that person actually said.

Word magic is also rampant in "gender" discussions. In fact, the very shift
from talking about a person's "sex" to talking about a person's "gender" was
itself an instance of word magic: the hope that renaming the biological reality
of sexual dimorphism as if it were an arbitrary category like gender in a
language might transform biological reality into social convention. (Consider
that the Tuyuca people, living in the Amazon, have over 50 noun genders in
their language: does anyone really think that this means that they recognize
over 50 sorts of "genders" of people?)

According to woke gender theory, people are "assigned"
a gender at birth. They "really" are whatever gender they
choose to adopt. (Notice the belief in *Zauberworte* implicit in this position:
it doesn't matter if you have a penis, testicles, and lots of testosterone
coursing through your body: just so long as others refer to you as "she," you
*really are* a woman. (And further, if they refer to you as "ze" or "they" or
"flaubergaustemis", then you *really are* some imaginary alternative sex.)

A quite recent instance of *Zauberworte* is the repeated declaration, no matter
how much violence actually is involved, that BLM and antifa activities are
always "peaceful protests." As Daniel McCarthy noted:

"‘Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station
and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified,’ ABC News
recently tweeted. The wording was perfect — better than any satire as an
illustration of the corporate media’s biases."
(https://spectator.us/mock-revolution-elites-protests-amazon/)

In this instance of *Zauberworte*, arson, vandalism, and assaults are merely an
"intensification" of peace.
No matter how much violence is occurring, so long as we *call* what is going on
"peaceful protests", they actually will be, magically, made peaceful. In the
meantime, a white person sitting quietly by himself, eating his lunch, is
actually engaged in *violence*, since he is not helping the peaceful protesters
loot stores and burn cars.

Perhaps one of the most stunning feats of *Zauberworte* performed by the woke
has been the re-definition of "racism" itself. The "old" definition is stated
succinctly at the beginning of the Wikipedia article on racism:

"Racism is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits
corresponding to physical appearance and can be divided based on the
superiority of one race over another." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism)
This definition captures what people usually mean when they say, "So-and-so is
a racist": that person thinks, for instance, that white people are superior to
black people.
It also fits well with historical examples of racism, such as the
ideas that supported black slavery in the United States or the persecution of
Jews in Nazi Germany. Quite clearly, it is not a definition designed to "support
white supremacy" or in any way "let white people off the hook": many of the
most egregious examples of racist belief and practice involve some white people
believing themselves genetically superior to some other group, although not
infrequently that has been another group of white people, for example, European
anti-semitism (Nazi Germany being the most extreme example), or the attitude of
the English towards the Irish for some centuries, or the widespread belief
among northern Europeans that they were better than their southern
counterparts. But, of course, there are many other examples of Europeans
holding racist beliefs vis-a-vis non-Europeans, towards Asian Indians, towards the
Chinese, towards American Indians, and towards black Africans.

Thankfully, although such beliefs persist in some quarters, today
they are widely discredited, and rejected by "polite society." For instance,
the University of Illinois reports: "One of the most substantial changes in
white racial attitudes [among Americans] 
has been the movement from very substantial opposition
to the principle of racial equality to one of almost universal support."
(https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes)

So, given that we should never expect perfection in the city of man, this would
seem to signal "mission accomplished," in terms of discrediting white racism,
right? But then, if one has built an ideological dream world holding that the
essential life difficulty facing black Americans is white racism, what is one
to do? Well, engage in some *Zauberworte*, and come up with a new definition of
racism, one that still condemns whites of this sin, despite the forementioned
change in attitudes, and, at the same time, excuses attitudes on the part of
non-whites that obviously would fall under the common-sense notion of what
racism is about.

The ideal of earlier opponents of racism, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, 
that "I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their
skin, but by the content of their character," has now been re-defined as being
actually a *racist* attitude, called "color-blindness." As Wikipedia expresses
the ideas of Eduardo Bonilla-Silva:
"At an individual level, people with 'color blind prejudice' reject racist
ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix institutional
racism." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism#Color_blindness) In other words,
in the realm of this word sorcery, *not* judging people by the color of their
skin is a "subtle" form of racism, and the evidence that a person is guilty of
this prejudice is that *they do not support the particular policies* their
accuser favors. The result is that if someone, for instance, opposes
affirmative-action admission to universities, arguing that they do not really
help black students, their argument need not even be entertained: that person
is a racist, guilty of "color blindness," and their case can be dismissed as
such.

In the face of such widespread sorcery, how can one resist its lure?
Well, recall that Faust makes his bargain with the devil in exchange for
unlimited wordly power and pleasure. So the armor that shields one against such
seduction is to adhere to the eternal moral verities, expoused by all the
world's great religions, and never abandon them for the sake of personal
advantage. But, of course, easier said than done!

Of course it would be wonderful if we could really eliminate all genuine
racism from the world. And furthermore, although such aspirations cannot be
achieved except in the city of God, we should not stop working towards such a
goal. (Similarly, while we cannot realistically hope to eliminate murder from
the world, we should never stop trying to eliminate as much murder as
possible.)

But engaging in the childish word games of the sorcerers does nothing to help
those most in need of our help. For instance, the plight of black Americans
trapped in inner-city housing projects should be a matter of grave concern for
all Americans. But changing what we call black Americans from "Negro" to
"colored" to "black" to "African-American" to "Black" has done exactly nothing
to help such people, and the actual programs pushed by "anti-racists" have
mostly just helped middle-class blacks to get somewhat more promotions than
they would have otherwise. A real solution to the terrible cirumstances of such
people will require fundamental re-evaluation of our social policies, and not
more word magic.
