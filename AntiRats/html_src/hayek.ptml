            </h2>

        <p>
            Hayek’s anti-rationalism is founded upon a revival of Scottish
            Enlightenment scepticism combined with a compelling account of
            psychology that rejects a correspondence between our categories
            that impose order on experience and an external reality. Despite
            the resulting austere epistemic standpoint, Hayek argues humans can
            harness their capacity for pattern recognition to generate and
            sustain cooperative social orders through non-rational processes of
            trial and error. Institutions that allow this cooperative order to
            persist include centrally private property, voluntary contract and
            the rule of law. Hayek’s politics is less reliant on fundamental
            normative claims than those based on utopian ideals and is
            compatible with a cosmopolitan order made up of people with varied
            conceptions of morality.
