# HyperCritical Race Theory

Gene Callahan

"Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small... the purpose is not
to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the
less it correspond to reality the better."
â€” Theodore Dalrymple

The charge of "whataboutism" is *not* a way of replying to a critic. It is a way of *ignoring* the critic. Look:

MARXIST: The capitalists exploited the workers.

CRITIC: OK, but what about the fact that the USSR threw millions of workers into Gulags?

MARXIST: Ah! Whataboutism!!!
