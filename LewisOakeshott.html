            <b>Abstract:</b>
            <br />
            C.S. Lewis was a major public intellectual in Britain, beginning
            from the late 1930s and continuing to his death in 1963. In both
            his non-fiction, especially <i>The Abolition of Man</i> (1943), and
            his fiction, most importantly in <i>That Hideous Strength</i>
            (1945), he offers a critique of rationalism and scientism that is
            often strikingly similar to those that Michael Oakeshott penned 
            in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This paper will examine the 
            question of to what extent this similarity is merely superficial,
            and to what extent the two writers shared a similar basis for their
            views. Furthermore, it will examine whether there is an actual
            thread of influence: had Oakeshott been reading Lewis before
            writing his critique of rationalism, and if so, to what extent did
            Lewis's work inform Oakeshott's?
