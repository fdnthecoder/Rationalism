        Beautiful Minds: Gregory Bateson on Humans, Animals and Ecological
        Systems

        In his study of anthropology and cybernetics, Bateson was led to expand
        the conception of mind to a wider range of systems that could learn and
        grow. Being a mind has to do with organizing, transforming and
        exchanging information. Most of that information is relayed below
        explicit awareness. An animal’s experience of beauty, for instance, can
        relay information about the health of a natural system. In Bateson’s
        expanded understanding, an ecological system itself can be a mind, and
        we humans can be parts of a larger mind that he identifies as
        "Creatura." Associating mind solely with our rationality can be
        pathological according to Bateson. In fact, acting purely rationally
        can be like one cancerous part overrunning a larger working system. A
        technocratic approach to society or exploitative approach to nature
        could thus be a form of madness. Sanity comes with ecological
        wholeness, i.e., with the realization and experience of our
        embeddedness in nature, and a respect for our tacit communication with
        other minds.

        Bateson makes important distinctions between levels in knowing and
        being that are consistent with Michael Polanyi's conceptions of tacit
        knowing and emergent dual control systems. We see learning happen below
        awareness, and we see minds within minds. Like Polanyi, Bateson
        challenges the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis by bringing intention and
        epigenetic learning back into natural evolution. Conceptions of "telos"
        and "field" come back in a non-obscurantist way consistent with Dynamic
        Systems and Connectionist computing approaches. Bateson's conception of
        mind, and patterns that connect, are thus important for our
        understanding of evolution, animals, ecology, ethics, and even
        Artificial Intelligence.
