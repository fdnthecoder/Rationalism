        Political division in America appears to be reaching a crescendo, and
        everything from medical opinions to climate change to each Tweet issued
        by the president is subjected to a partisan litmus test by the media,
        politicians, and also ordinary citizens. Increasing politicization is
        leading to a radical fracturing of American society along ideological
        lines, with each side finding support for its position in historical,
        sociological, and even scientific claims antithetical to those of the
        opposing side. No longer are individual studies and historical episodes
        debated for veracity, but the entirety of Western history and
        civilization is being debated

        In order to understand this division, it is necessary to reexamine the
        fundamental Enlightenment concept of reason that for so long has
        decisively affected the ways in which we conceptualize politics and try
        to effect social change. One of the first thinkers to oppose Cartesian
        rationalism, the lifeblood of Enlightenment thinking, and to offer a
        thoroughgoing philosophical counterargument was Giambattista Vico
        (1668-1744). From the perspective of Italian civic humanism, Vico
        argues that the imagination, rather than reason, is responsible not
        only for the development of culture and civilization but also our
        ability to know with certainty—following the project of Descartes—the
        nature of human existence. The considerable epistemological and
        philosophical insights of this eighteenth-century Neapolitan thinker
        can help us to understand the origins in the imagination of the current
        political divide and also help us to reach our political adversaries
        through proper use of the imagination in the form of eloquence and find
        common ground.
